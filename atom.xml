Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Google Find My Device"></a>1. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.</p><p>Since you’re locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google’s Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the <strong>Erase device</strong> choice on this page to reset it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2.

To do as such:</p><ul><li>Power your device off.</li><li>Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android’s bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.</li><li>Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.</li><li>Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset choice.

Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.</p><p>If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.</li><li>Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.</li><li>Type in adb shell rm&#x2F;data&#x2F;system&#x2F;gesture.key and click the Enter key.</li><li>Reboot your phone.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Oppo A56s 5G device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Oppo A56s 5G” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the Oppo A56s 5G device first. Also, because of this, any one who can access your phone can see your information from widgets. But since Lollipop update, widgets has been changed to Notifications on Android.

This is meant to keep the phone secure and prevent any unwanted intrusion. PINs and patterns are somewhat easy to remember, but it is common to forget the Android lock screen password. The phone gets locked if someone consecutively enters the wrong password multiple times. Then it is a common question to ask, “How to reset your Android password?”</p><p>The device becomes inaccessible and requires an Android password reset. But there is no easy way to do that. Either one needs their Gmail account or has to forget about getting back the Android data. Today we will deliver how to reset Android passwords and teach 6 useful ways. They can be used to reset the Android password and use the phone again. But if someone has to perform a factory restore, they need to depend on backups to get back the data.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Oppo A1x 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.</p><p>The issue limits the smartphone’s functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Oppo A1x 5G device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited.

Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo A1 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo A1 5G  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo A1 5G :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of “Network” is 0, your device can’t be unlocked as it is hard-locked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg"                      alt="check the network status"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input “*#06#” on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Oppo A1 5G  device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-7.jpg"                      alt="enter the sim unlock code"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?</h2><p>Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages.

Here’s an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the “Dialer” app, dial the number “*#*#7378423#*#*“ and access the “Rooting Status” option within the “Service Provider” settings.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the bootloader status displays “Yes,” ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable “USB Debugging” and “OEM Unlocking” on your smartphone and switch it off.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Connect the Oppo A1 5G  smartphone with a USB cable and press the “Power + Volume Up” keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the “Devices and Printers” directory. Right-click on the “fastboot driver” file, select “Update,” and select the location of the “android_winbus.inf” file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: <code>adb reboot bootloader</code></p><p>Unlock the bootloader with the following command: <code>fastboot oem unlock 0x&lt;insert your unlock code</code></p><p>Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: <code>fastboot reboot</code></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Forgetting your Oppo A1 5G  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device. Click on the Need helpline, which is highlighted in blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546021103734.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, you will be moved to the Google Account Recovery page. There will be 3 main options which indicate 3 frequent problems. Select the first one, which is entitled “I don’t know my password”. Once you have chosen it, you will be required to fill in your Gmail address in the bar provided. Click on the Continue button as long as you have made sure to finish all these tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022254697.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-create an account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In this step, you may be asked to fill in a CAPCHA form. Just simply do it and move to the next page. There you had better type in the last password that you are still able to recall if possible, then click on the Continue button to move. Or else, you can skip this step by clicking on I don’t know button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022088819.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-fill in a CAPCHA form"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you will be shown a list of options on how to reset your Gmail password on Android devices. You can either use your alternative email address or your phone number to receive a verification code. Bear in mind to fill in any required information and put a check in the CAPCHA box to submit the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022423041.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-submit the process"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In this step, a blank bar will appear and it will demand you to type in your verification code. Just do it carefully to make sure there is no error. Once you have done it, a new screen will appear to tell you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022635082.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-type in your verification code"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022939368.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-account assistance"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After you have done all the previous steps, you will know how to reset your Gmail password directly from your Android device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-Gmail-Password-When-You-Still-Know-it"><a href="#Part-2-Change-Gmail-Password-When-You-Still-Know-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change Gmail Password When You Still Know it"></a>Part 2: Change Gmail Password When You Still Know it</h2><p>Besides not knowing your password, there are still circumstances when you wish to change your current password for various reasons.

Below are the 5 most helpful tips that we want to offer you.</p><ol><li>Far from your imagination, Gmail on Android devices is capable of allowing you to make use of several accounts at the same time, even if it’s not a Gmail account. This performance not only helps you to organize your work better, but it also increase the efficiency of your job. Just simply log in your Gmail account on Gmail app, click on the down arrow which is placed next to your avatar and name, then choose Add account. You will be moved to another page, choose Personal (IMAP&#x2F;POP) choice and follow the detailed guide on the screen.</li><li>If your Android device is used by only one user, and you are guaranteed about the security of it, try to keep the Gmail logged in. It would help you to avoid wasting unnecessary time to sign in your account every time you need, not to mention that it prevent you from being confused of not knowing your account&#x2F;password.</li><li>You are capable of sorting your mails with a certain level of accuracy once you are fully aware of the features of Gmail app on Android devices. Just click on the email, then choose Settings menu and mark it as “Mark as not important”, “Mark important” or “Report to spam” owing to the priority of your email.</li><li>Gmail app provided you with the ability to have conversations online, and whenever a message comes, there will be a sound. In case you are in a vital conference, or you don’t want to be disturbed by the noise, you can mute it. All you have to do is to tap into the conversation, choose the three dots icon then click on the Mute option in the menu.</li><li>Enhance the speed and the accuracy of your search with the use of certain phrases. Let’s take an instance to see what Gmail can do for you in this case. If you want to search for the mails which have been sent by a certain person, typefrom:(name of the person on Gmail) in the searching bar. And in case you would love to look for a private message from that person, please type is:chat:(name of the person on Gmail) .</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices"></a>Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvCMAn5bwx8" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-realme-gt-neo-5-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Solutions For Realme GT Neo 5 Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-lock-screen-settings-how-to-enable-and-disable-on-poco-c55-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Lock Screen Settings How to Enable and Disable on Poco C55</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-change-nokia-c300-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Nokia C300 Lock Screen Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-poco-m6-pro-5g-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Poco M6 Pro 5G Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-realme-10t-5g-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/"><u>Still Using Pattern Locks with Realme 10T 5G?

Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition.

Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5.

This is meant to keep the phone secure and prevent any unwanted intrusion. PINs and patterns are somewhat easy to remember, but it is common to forget the Android lock screen password.

Either one needs their Gmail account or has to forget about getting back the Android data. Today we will deliver how to reset Android passwords and teach 6 useful ways. They can be used to reset the Android password and use the phone again. But if someone has to perform a factory restore, they need to depend on backups to get back the data.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone’s Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device locks.</p><p>If you’re at home, it’s likely your android phone is locked out if you haven’t accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won’t lock. Trusted devices come next.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5.

If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin"                ></p><ul><li>10.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

Next up, we’ll guide you through the steps in several ways. Let’s start with the Developer options.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-Missing-From-the-Developer-Options"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-Missing-From-the-Developer-Options" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Enable OEM Unlock Missing From the Developer Options?"></a>Part 3: How To Enable OEM Unlock Missing From the Developer Options?</h2><p>Developer Options, a hidden menu in Android, offers advanced features like app debugging and custom ROM installation. But if the Android OEM unlock option is missing, you can’t unlock your device’s bootloader. Below is a step-by-step guide for you so the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> option will show in the Developer Options. Remember, this process may erase your device data, so a complete backup is essential before proceeding.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your Android phone.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>About Phone</strong> at the bottom of the list, then tap <strong>Software information</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-08.jpg"                      alt="software information settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the <strong>Build number</strong> repeatedly (7 times) until you see a message saying, “<strong>You are now a developer!</strong>“ or similar.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> and find the <strong>Developer options</strong> menu.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Scroll down and tap the toggle switch next to <strong>Enable OEM Unlock</strong> to turn it on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-09.jpg"                      alt="enable oem unlock developer option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> A warning message explaining the risks of turning on the OEM unlock will appear. Read it carefully and tap <strong>Enable</strong> if you want to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-10.jpg"                      alt="turn on oem unlock"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your PIN or password to confirm the unlock when prompted</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Your device will reboot, and OEM Unlocking will be enabled.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Fix-OEM-Unlock-Missing-by-Adjusting-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Fix-OEM-Unlock-Missing-by-Adjusting-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing by Adjusting Date and Time?"></a>Part 4: How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing by Adjusting Date and Time?</h2><p>Some manufacturers intentionally delay the availability of the OEM unlock after a software update for security reasons. Changing the date to a past date before the update rolled out can trick the system into displaying the option, as it thinks the update hasn’t happened yet. It is a temporary fix, and the option will likely disappear again later when the OnePlus Ace 3 device automatically syncs the correct date.</p><p>If you intend to try this method, follow these steps to <strong>enable OEM unlock missing</strong> or greyed out after an Android update:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong> or <strong>General management</strong>, depending on your Android version.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Turn off <strong>Automatic date and time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-11.jpg"                      alt="turn off automatic date and time"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on <strong>Set date</strong> and choose the desired older date from the calendar.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap on <strong>Set time</strong> and choose the desired time from the clock.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Tap on <strong>Done</strong> to save the changes.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Go back to the <strong>Developers options</strong> and turn off the <strong>Auto update system</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-12.jpg"                      alt="turn off auto update system"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Software update</strong>, then turn off <strong>Auto download over Wi-Fi</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-13.jpg"                      alt="turn off auto download over wi-fi"                ></p><p>This method should <strong>enable the OEM unlock missing</strong> issue.

For these phones, unlocking the SIM card becomes crucial before you can toggle the OEM unlock option. Here are the steps to fix the <strong>OEM Unlock missing</strong> or greyed out using SIM card removal:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the SIM ejector tool (often included with your phone) or a small pin to push the tray out.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong>, then select <strong>Factory data reset</strong>. Enter your PIN or password if needed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-14.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Review the warning and tap <strong>Reset</strong> to confirm.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the reset is complete, your phone will restart. Connect to Wi-Fi when prompted.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Skip any prompts to log in to your Google or email account. Then, repeat the process to open the <strong>Developer Options</strong> in the previous sections.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Having the <strong>OEM Unlock missing</strong> or greyed out can leave Android users feeling locked out of customization possibilities. Fortunately, this article has outlined helpful solutions like enabling the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> option via the Developer Options. You can also try other methods above, like adjusting date and time settings or even a sim card removal trick. For those facing forgotten lock screens, we’ve offered guidance on bypassing them using the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool to access the necessary phone settings.</p><p>While these methods provide a solid foundation, it’s always wise to research steps specific to your phone model.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4.

This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the OnePlus Ace 2V device manufacturer.</p><p>For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of <strong>OEM unlocking on Android</strong>, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg"                      alt="android phone with padlock"                ></p><p><strong>OEM lock</strong> might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the OnePlus Ace 2V device.</p><p>This process allows you to gain deeper access to the OnePlus Ace 2V device’s software. Thus, OEM unlocking is often required for customizing or modifying the system at a more advanced level.</p><h3 id="Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Why Enable OEM Unlock?"></a>Why Enable OEM Unlock?</h3><p>The primary reason to enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware, also known as ROMs. Rooting is the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. It allows users to access and modify the OnePlus Ace 2V device’s software at the deepest level.</p><p>This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface. They can also add features not available in the stock version of Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-02.jpg"                      alt="android oem unlocking settings"                ></p><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking"></a>Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking</h3><p>Here are some great things you can get when you <strong>allow OEM unlock.</strong></p><ul><li>The most significant advantage is the ability to customize your device far beyond what’s possible with standard settings.</li><li><strong>Root access.</strong> It allows for rooting the phone enabling advanced features and apps.</li><li><strong>Custom ROMs.</strong> Users can install different versions of Android or entirely new operating systems.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, here are some cons that you must consider before performing the process on your phone:</p><ul><li><strong>Security risks.</strong> Root access can make your device more vulnerable to malware and hacking.</li><li><strong>Void warranty.</strong> OEM unlocking often voids the manufacturer’s warranty.</li><li><strong>Potential for bricking.</strong> Incorrect procedures can render the OnePlus Ace 2V device unusable, known as ‘bricking’.</li></ul><h3 id="Understanding-the-Risks"><a href="#Understanding-the-Risks" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Risks"></a>Understanding the Risks</h3><p>It’s crucial to understand that OEM unlocking is not without its risks. It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.</p><p>Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader. This leaves you without support in case something goes wrong. So, in the next sections, you’ll be guided through the steps of OEM unlocking.

Enabling OEM unlock may require a factory reset, which erases all data on the OnePlus Ace 2V device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings &gt; About Phone. Then, tap on the Build number seven times. You should see a message that says you’re now a developer.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and select Developer options on Settings. Then, tap <strong>OEM unlocking</strong>. You might need to enter a PIN or password.</li></ul><p>Here are some common links where you might find the needed PIN or password:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/"><u>HTC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.lge.com/resource/mobile/RetrieveBootloader.dev?categoryTypeCode=ANRS"><u>LG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.sonymobile.com/unlockbootloader/unlock-yourboot-loader/"><u>Sony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://community.gethuawei.com/developers/f/48/t/1048"><u>Huawei</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.motorola.com/https://accounts.motorola.com/ssoauth/login?TARGET=https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/cc/cas/sso/redirect/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-b"><u>Motorola</u></a></li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html"><u>Samsung</u></a></li></ul><p>After these steps, your device’s bootloader is now unlocked, and you can proceed with rooting or installing custom ROMs. Remember that this is a significant change to your device’s system, and it should be done cautiously and ideally only if you’re comfortable with potential risks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Can-You-Do-After-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-What-Can-You-Do-After-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?"></a>Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s OEM opens up a world of possibilities. It allows you to customize your device beyond what’s available in its factory settings. This newfound freedom, however, comes with its own set of responsibilities and risks. Here’s what you can do after having your phone <strong>OEM unlocked</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-04.jpg"                      alt="android custom roms"                ></p><h3 id="Root-Your-Device"><a href="#Root-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Root Your Device"></a>Root Your Device</h3><p>Rooting is akin to having the master key to your device’s software. It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:</p><ul><li>Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.</li><li>Customize system settings and UI elements.</li><li>Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.</li></ul><h3 id="Flash-a-Custom-ROM"><a href="#Flash-a-Custom-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Flash a Custom ROM"></a>Flash a Custom ROM</h3><p>A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device. This is one of the most popular reasons for OEM unlocking. Custom ROMs offer:</p><ul><li>The latest Android updates, even for older devices, are no longer supported by manufacturers.</li><li>New features and customization options that aren’t available in the stock ROM.</li><li>Potential performance improvements and unique user interfaces.</li></ul><h3 id="Enjoy-High-Customization"><a href="#Enjoy-High-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy High Customization"></a>Enjoy High Customization</h3><p>With an OEM unlocked device, the sky’s the limit regarding customization. You can:</p><ul><li>Install custom kernels for better performance and battery life.</li><li>Use powerful apps that require root access for advanced device management.</li><li>Customize everything from the boot animation to the layout of your UI.</li></ul><p>However, it’s crucial to proceed with caution. Rooting and installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and, if not done correctly, can turn your device into an expensive paperweight (a state often referred to as “bricking”). Always use reliable sources for your custom ROMs and root-access apps.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password"><a href="#Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password"></a>Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/guide-to-unlock-mi-account-without-password.html"><u>Forgetting the password </u></a> to your Android phone can be a stressful experience.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the OnePlus Ace 2 device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My OnePlus Ace 2” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the OnePlus Ace 2 device first. Also, because of this, any one who can access your phone can see your information from widgets. But since Lollipop update, widgets has been changed to Notifications on Android. Here, let’s see how to set customize widgets on Android running OS before lollipop. You can also find some <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/android-lock-screen-widgets.html" >useful alternatives to lock screen widgets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here.</p><p>For devices running Android 4.2 or 4.3, lock screen widgets are enabled by default. So you can use them directly. For users of KitKat, you can go to Settings, select Security, and find Enable Widgets option. To add a new widget to the lock screen, swipe the screen from left to right until there is a plus on the screen. Tap the plus and select the widget you would like to add. You can also drag the widgets to repalce it.</p><p><strong>Smart Lock on Android</strong></p><p>Smart Lock is a new feature introduced in Lollipop. It helps you keep your device unlocked when it’ safe with you, by recognizing locations, bluetooth system, or smartwatch etc. To know more about <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/smart-lock-android.html" >Smart lock settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, just follow the information here.</p><p><strong>Customize Lock Screen Wallpaper</strong></p><p>Except all the different types lock method to protect your phone, there are also many wallpapers to make your lock screen lool beautiful or cool.
