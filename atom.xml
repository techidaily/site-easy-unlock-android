This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo A78 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo A78 5G  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo A78 5G :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen.

Google Find My Device"></a>1. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.</p><p>Since you’re locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google’s Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the <strong>Erase device</strong> choice on this page to reset it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset"></a>2. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset</h3><p>If you can’t use the Find my device feature, you’ll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:</p><ul><li>Power your device off.</li><li>Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android’s bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.</li><li>Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.</li><li>Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset choice.

Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.</p><p>If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.</li><li>Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.</li><li>Type in adb shell rm&#x2F;data&#x2F;system&#x2F;gesture.key and click the Enter key.</li><li>Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.</li><li>That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That’s how you reset <strong>password for phone.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>If you want to unlock your phone without losing any data, we suggest Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo F23 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo F23 5G  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo F23 5G :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen.

However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Oppo A78  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Oppo A78 device and its password.</p><p>Here’s how to unlock the Oppo A78  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo A78 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo A78  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo A78 :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t.

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2.

If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Oppo A56s 5G devices registered to this Android account will pop up.

If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6.

This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>.

So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the <strong>Root Explorer</strong> option and enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Get the passwords’ file.</p><p>Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named <strong>data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>When this folder opens, find another one named <strong>misc</strong>. Open it and find another one named <strong>wifi</strong>. Here, find a file named <strong>wpa_supplicant.conf</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android</p><p>Make sure that you don’t edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by <em>name (ssid&#x3D;”{the name}”)</em>, the network’s password represented by <em>psk</em>, the network’s access point represented by <em>key_mgmt&#x3D;WPA-PSK</em> and its priority represented by <em>priority</em>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root"></a>Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root</h2><p>What if I don’t have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root"><a href="#Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root"></a>Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root</h3><p>Step 1: Access the Developer authority</p><p>To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.</p><p>Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find “About phone.” Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Tap on this “build number” 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, “You are now a developer”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable the debugging.</p><p>Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for “Android&#x2F;USB debugging”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Install ADB drivers.</p><p>Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link <a class="link"   href="http://adbdriver.com/" >adbdriver.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from <a class="link"   href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790" >http://forum.xda-developers.com/... <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now open the folder where you’ve installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc <em>C\windows\system32\platform_tools</em> location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on”Open Command Window Here.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Test the ADB</p><p>Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type <strong>adb services</strong> and then press enter. If it’s working properly, you should see a device on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.</p><p>Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: <em>adb pull &#x2F;data&#x2F;misc&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf c:&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf</em>. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.</p><p>Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.</p><p>Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-oem-unlock-missing-on-oppo-k11-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing on Oppo K11 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-realme-c67-4g-phone-without-google-account-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Realme C67 4G Phone without Google Account?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-how-to-bypass-swipe-screen-to-unlock-on-realme-note-50-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide How to Bypass Swipe Screen to Unlock on Realme Note 50 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-realme-v30-face-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Full Tutorial to Bypass Your Realme V30 Face Lock?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-oppo-find-x6-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove or Bypass Knox Enrollment Service On Oppo Find X6 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-realme-c33-2023-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Realme C33 2023 Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-nubia-red-magic-8s-pro-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlock Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-made-easy-the-best-10-apps-for-unlocking-your-nokia-c12-plus-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Made Easy The Best 10 Apps for Unlocking Your Nokia C12 Plus Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-screenflow-showdown-the-top-video-editing-software-for-macos-users-for-2024/"><u>[New] ScreenFlow Showdown  The Top Video Editing Software for macOS Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/will-ispoofer-update-on-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Will iSpoofer update On Oppo A18 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-amplifying-impact-youtube-visibility-techniques/"><u>[New] Amplifying Impact  YouTube Visibility Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-streammastery-101-the-beginners-path-to-livestrancing-podcasts/"><u>In 2024, StreamMastery 101  The Beginner's Path to Livestrancing Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-innovative-approaches-to-tiktok-lives-from-desktop-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Innovative Approaches to TikTok Lives From Desktop Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-stabilizing-aerial-vision-a-comprehensive-guide-to-choosing-a-gimbal/"><u>[Updated] Stabilizing Aerial Vision  A Comprehensive Guide to Choosing a Gimbal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-no-cost-approach-to-blending-audio-and-visual-elements-for-dynamic-clips/"><u>In 2024, The No-Cost Approach to Blending Audio and Visual Elements for Dynamic Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-disabled-iphone-13-pro-max-without-itunes-in-5-ways-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max Without iTunes in 5 Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-when-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-has-black-screen-of-death-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What To Do When Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Has Black Screen of Death? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Oppo A56s 5G device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin"                ></p><ul><li>10. Similarly, you would be required to confirm the pin as well to finish the setup.</li><li>11. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.</li></ul><p>Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?"></a>Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?</h2><p>After following the above-mentioned tutorial, you would be able to set up a pattern lock screen on your device.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo A58 4G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo A58 4G  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo A58 4G :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of “Network” is 0, your device can’t be unlocked as it is hard-locked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg"                      alt="check the network status"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input “*#06#” on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Oppo A58 4G  device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-7.jpg"                      alt="enter the sim unlock code"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?</h2><p>Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages.

It is, however, important to find a way to unlock the broken device so that you can gain access to your data and create a backup to restore to a new device.</p><p>In this article, we are going to look at a few simple ways you can unlock an Android device with a broken screen.</p><p><strong>Here is a video for you to learn how to unlock Android phone or access phone with broken screen:</strong></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaWEiQhxBTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Method-1-Using-Android-Debug-Bridge-ADB"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Android-Debug-Bridge-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)"></a>Method 1: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</h2><p>For this method, you will need your device and access to a PC. It is the most powerful method to unlock a broken Android device. It will however only work if you have enabled USB debugging on your android phone. If you haven’t, skip this method and see if method 2 or 3 might be of help.</p><p>ADB creates a bridge between the PC and your device which can then be used to unlock the Oppo A1x 5G device. Here’s how to use this bridge.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Android SDK package on your PC. You can download it here: <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Extract the ZIP file on your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download the necessary drivers for your device. The USB drivers for your device can be found on the manufacturer’s website.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Launch Command Prompt on your PC and change the location of the ADB file. Type in the following into Command Prompt; <em>cd C:&#x2F;android&#x2F;platform-tools</em></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Connect the Oppo A1x 5G device to your PC using USB cables. Enter the command “ ADB _device_” (without quotation marks). If your phone is recognized, you will see numbers in the Command Prompt message.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Type in the following two commands. You will need to type in the second one immediately after the first. Replace 1234 with your password.</p><p><em>ADB shell input text 1234</em><br><em>Shell input key event 66</em></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Your phone will now be unlocked and you can proceed to back up its contents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Best Tool to Reset Phones Without Android Factory Reset Codes</p><ul><li>It enables your Android phones to get safe, simple, and trustful after reset.</li><li>It is still helpful even though you don’t know the OS version of your devices.</li><li>Everybody can handle it without any technical background.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,670</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter"></a>Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter</h2><p>This is a great solution if you don’t have USB debugging enabled on your device. You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Oppo A1x 5G device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.</p><p>Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933625473.jpg"                      alt="connect broken screen android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as the Oppo A1x 5G devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen. You can then use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the Oppo A1x 5G device’s password lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933791903.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p>You can then go about backing up the contents of your device.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using your Samsung Account"></a>Method 3: Using your Samsung Account</h2><p>This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly. While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do" >https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933993021.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531934188479.jpg"                      alt="unlock android using samsung account"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be.

Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice"></a>Still Using Pattern Locks with Oppo A1x 5G? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice</h2><p>They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Oppo-A1x-5G-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Oppo-A1x-5G-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

Working on this service is quite straightforward, and it only works if the user has a Google account. This service is accessible and usable from any device or computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-1.jpg"                      alt="unlock android screen 15"                ></p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Oppo A58 4G device, we can begin by pressing the “Lock” button.</p><p>After pressing the “Lock” button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock android screen 16"                ></p><p>Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Oppo A58 4G device.</p><h3 id="Way-5-Use-Forgot-Pattern-Feature-Android-4-4-Version-and-Earlier"><a href="#Way-5-Use-Forgot-Pattern-Feature-Android-4-4-Version-and-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature [Android 4.4 Version and Earlier]"></a>Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature [Android 4.4 Version and Earlier]</h3><p>If you use an older Android version, you can get rid of the <strong>universal unlock pattern</strong> by forgot pattern feature. On earlier Android devices, this feature is enabled by default. After a few failed attempts, the warning “Try again in 30 seconds” appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Simply enter wrong pattern too many times until try again in 30 seconds warning comes.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the “Forgot Pattern” option below the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/forgot-pattern-1.jpg"                      alt="unlock android screen 17"                ></p><p>Enter the primary Gmail account and password you used to set up your Android smartphone after selecting the same. Then you must provide your Google account information. A new unlock pattern will be emailed to you by Google.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/forgot-pattern-2.jpg"                      alt="aunlock android screen 18"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Universal unlock patterns allow</strong> you to unlock your phone easily when you think you have forgotten.

After affirming the Delete capability, your phone will boot into recovery and begin playing out a production line reset. It is difficult to stop or drop on your android gadget when you endorse this activity. Regardless of whether you shut down your Android phone - the reboot will continue on startup.</p><h3 id="2-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#2-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Recovery Mode"></a>2. Recovery Mode</h3><p>Depending on your phone, the steps for this process might vary a little. Most phones will allow you to reset by getting to the recovery mode. Follow the steps below to remove the <strong>Android screen lock:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on the Oppo A58 4G device and enter the boot menu. If you want to know how to do so, you can do a speed search on the internet.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Access the safe mode, use the volume keys to navigate, and press the Power key to click.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Search for the Wipe Data option and select it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-3.jpg"                      alt="wipe data"                ></p><p>After that, your Android will start the process, which can require a few minutes. However, this process will erase all your user data.</p><h3 id="3-Use-ADB"><a href="#3-Use-ADB" class="headerlink" title="3. Use ADB"></a>3. Use ADB</h3><p>This method is very confusing, so follow the steps cautiously on your Android phone to remove the <strong>phone lock</strong>.

Boot into Safe Mode"></a>4. Boot into Safe Mode</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For most phones and your Android, you can do this by opening the power menu and holding the “Power Off.” A message will spring up on your screen, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Press Ok.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Clear data from your lock screen application, uninstall and reboot your phone to escape the Safe mode. When you do so, your Android <strong>screen lock</strong> will unlock.</p><h3 id="5-Crash-Lock-Screen"><a href="#5-Crash-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="5. Crash Lock Screen"></a>5. Crash Lock Screen</h3><p>This strategy to sidestep a locked screen is only a crisis workaround for the phones in this classification.</p><ul><li>Enter ten asterisks (*) through the dialer application.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-5.jpg"                      alt="ten asterisks"                ></p><ul><li>Copy and paste asterisks on the dialer until the “Paste” choice no longer appears.</li><li>Get back to the lock screen and tap on the camera symbol.</li><li>Go to the settings on your Android after pulling down the notifications bar. Now you will have the chance to enter the password, and you must continue the same thing here. Continue to paste until the Android lock screen crashes.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Passwords shield our phones from unapproved access, yet we get locked out unexpectedly on our <strong>phone lock</strong>.

Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.</p><p>Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.</p><p>Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.</p><p><strong>Brute Force Password Cracking:</strong></p><p>Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.</p><p>A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" >dictionary attack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technique is normally used.</p><p>Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.</p><p><strong>GPU Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit. Before talking about GPU password cracking we must have some understanding about <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" >hashes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.</p><p>In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.</p><p>GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so that’s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.</p><p><strong>CUDA Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" >CUDA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.</p><p>CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.</p><p>We can easily access CUDA through libraries, directives and with the help of different programming languages that includes C, C++ and FORTRAN.</p><p><strong>Password Cracking Tools</strong></p><p>Given below is the list of Top10 Password cracking tools.</p><h2 id="1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows"><a href="#1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This article will delve into the process of <strong>OEM unlocking on Android</strong>, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg"                      alt="android phone with padlock"                ></p><p><strong>OEM lock</strong> might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the Oppo A1x 5G device.</p><p>This process allows you to gain deeper access to the Oppo A1x 5G device’s software. Thus, OEM unlocking is often required for customizing or modifying the system at a more advanced level.</p><h3 id="Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Why Enable OEM Unlock?"></a>Why Enable OEM Unlock?</h3><p>The primary reason to enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware, also known as ROMs. Rooting is the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. It allows users to access and modify the Oppo A1x 5G device’s software at the deepest level.</p><p>This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface. They can also add features not available in the stock version of Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-02.jpg"                      alt="android oem unlocking settings"                ></p><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking"></a>Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking</h3><p>Here are some great things you can get when you <strong>allow OEM unlock.</strong></p><ul><li>The most significant advantage is the ability to customize your device far beyond what’s possible with standard settings.</li><li><strong>Root access.</strong> It allows for rooting the phone enabling advanced features and apps.</li><li><strong>Custom ROMs.</strong> Users can install different versions of Android or entirely new operating systems.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, here are some cons that you must consider before performing the process on your phone:</p><ul><li><strong>Security risks.</strong> Root access can make your device more vulnerable to malware and hacking.</li><li><strong>Void warranty.</strong> OEM unlocking often voids the manufacturer’s warranty.</li><li><strong>Potential for bricking.</strong> Incorrect procedures can render the Oppo A1x 5G device unusable, known as ‘bricking’.</li></ul><h3 id="Understanding-the-Risks"><a href="#Understanding-the-Risks" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Risks"></a>Understanding the Risks</h3><p>It’s crucial to understand that OEM unlocking is not without its risks. It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.</p><p>Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader. This leaves you without support in case something goes wrong. So, in the next sections, you’ll be guided through the steps of OEM unlocking. You’ll also learn how to do it safely, ensuring you make the most out of your Android device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-on-Your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-on-Your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone</h2><p><strong>Enabling OEM unlock</strong> can feel like stepping into uncharted territory. Still, it’s relatively straightforward if you follow the right steps. Before you start, it’s important to remember that the exact process can vary slightly depending on your device’s brand and model. However, the general steps are usually similar across most Android devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-03.jpg"                      alt="android developer options"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before proceeding, ensure you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html"><u>back up all important data</u></a>. Enabling OEM unlock may require a factory reset, which erases all data on the Oppo A1x 5G device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings &gt; About Phone. Then, tap on the Build number seven times. You should see a message that says you’re now a developer.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and select Developer options on Settings. Then, tap <strong>OEM unlocking</strong>. You might need to enter a PIN or password.</li></ul><p>Here are some common links where you might find the needed PIN or password:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/"><u>HTC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.lge.com/resource/mobile/RetrieveBootloader.dev?categoryTypeCode=ANRS"><u>LG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.sonymobile.com/unlockbootloader/unlock-yourboot-loader/"><u>Sony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://community.gethuawei.com/developers/f/48/t/1048"><u>Huawei</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.motorola.com/https://accounts.motorola.com/ssoauth/login?TARGET=https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/cc/cas/sso/redirect/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-b"><u>Motorola</u></a></li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html"><u>Samsung</u></a></li></ul><p>After these steps, your device’s bootloader is now unlocked, and you can proceed with rooting or installing custom ROMs. Remember that this is a significant change to your device’s system, and it should be done cautiously and ideally only if you’re comfortable with potential risks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Can-You-Do-After-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-What-Can-You-Do-After-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?"></a>Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s OEM opens up a world of possibilities. It allows you to customize your device beyond what’s available in its factory settings. This newfound freedom, however, comes with its own set of responsibilities and risks. Here’s what you can do after having your phone <strong>OEM unlocked</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-04.jpg"                      alt="android custom roms"                ></p><h3 id="Root-Your-Device"><a href="#Root-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Root Your Device"></a>Root Your Device</h3><p>Rooting is akin to having the master key to your device’s software. It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:</p><ul><li>Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.</li><li>Customize system settings and UI elements.</li><li>Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.</li></ul><h3 id="Flash-a-Custom-ROM"><a href="#Flash-a-Custom-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Flash a Custom ROM"></a>Flash a Custom ROM</h3><p>A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device. This is one of the most popular reasons for OEM unlocking. Custom ROMs offer:</p><ul><li>The latest Android updates, even for older devices, are no longer supported by manufacturers.</li><li>New features and customization options that aren’t available in the stock ROM.</li><li>Potential performance improvements and unique user interfaces.</li></ul><h3 id="Enjoy-High-Customization"><a href="#Enjoy-High-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy High Customization"></a>Enjoy High Customization</h3><p>With an OEM unlocked device, the sky’s the limit regarding customization. You can:</p><ul><li>Install custom kernels for better performance and battery life.</li><li>Use powerful apps that require root access for advanced device management.</li><li>Customize everything from the boot animation to the layout of your UI.</li></ul><p>However, it’s crucial to proceed with caution. Rooting and installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and, if not done correctly, can turn your device into an expensive paperweight (a state often referred to as “bricking”). Always use reliable sources for your custom ROMs and root-access apps.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password"><a href="#Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password"></a>Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/guide-to-unlock-mi-account-without-password.html"><u>Forgetting the password </u></a> to your Android phone can be a stressful experience.
