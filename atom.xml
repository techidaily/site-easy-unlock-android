This measure is implemented to guarantee that the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your OnePlus Nord N30 5G  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a OnePlus Nord N30 5G :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen.

This technique works with most OnePlus devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power&#x2F;home key to select anything. Use these keys and select the “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset” option. You might get another pop-up asking to delete all user data. Just agree it reset your device. Sit back and relax as your device will perform a hard reset.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204518630.jpg"                      alt="unlock lg forgot password - enter in recovery mode"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Select the “Reboot system now” option to restart it.

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the OnePlus Nord N30 5G devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6. Once you have been redirected to the ‘reset password’ page, you can input your new login information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637552475841.jpg"                      alt="android Google reset link"                ></p><p>7. Finally, you can unlock your Google account on your Android! Confirm this by clicking the “Change Password” button. Success!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637552534874.jpg"                      alt="android Google reset password input new password"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Locked-Screen-on-Android-using-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Locked-Screen-on-Android-using-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Ensure that the phone is turned off, and press and hold the “Volume Down” button when connecting the cable to the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-3.jpg"                      alt="preparing the computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once correctly connected to the PC, the program will download the necessary software and upload it to your device. After completing the process, you can unplug the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device and turn it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-4.jpg"                      alt="updating the xiaomi device"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Operator-Lock-on-OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Operator-Lock-on-OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Operator Lock on OnePlus Nord N30 5G ?"></a>How to Remove Operator Lock on OnePlus Nord N30 5G ?</h2><p>An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your OnePlus Nord N30 5G  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a OnePlus Nord N30 5G :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of “Network” is 0, your device can’t be unlocked as it is hard-locked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg"                      alt="check the network status"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input “*#06#” on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your OnePlus Nord N30 5G  device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-7.jpg"                      alt="enter the sim unlock code"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?</h2><p>Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here’s an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the “Dialer” app, dial the number “*#*#7378423#*#*“ and access the “Rooting Status” option within the “Service Provider” settings.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the bootloader status displays “Yes,” ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable “USB Debugging” and “OEM Unlocking” on your smartphone and switch it off.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Connect the OnePlus Nord N30 5G  smartphone with a USB cable and press the “Power + Volume Up” keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the “Devices and Printers” directory. Right-click on the “fastboot driver” file, select “Update,” and select the location of the “android_winbus.inf” file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: <code>adb reboot bootloader</code></p><p>Unlock the bootloader with the following command: <code>fastboot oem unlock 0x&lt;insert your unlock code</code></p><p>Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: <code>fastboot reboot</code></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Forgetting your OnePlus Nord N30 5G  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common. For such instances, there are several methods that you can use to unlock your screen, 5 of which we have discussed in this article.</p><p>If you’re looking for ways that are time-effective and reliable, you can use your Google account or other ways to unlock OnePlus Nord N30 5G  and set a new screen lock. However, with these methods, you can lose your data, so we only recommend using them if your device is backed up.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-made-easy-the-best-10-apps-for-unlocking-your-honor-magic-6-pro-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Made Easy The Best 10 Apps for Unlocking Your Honor Magic 6 Pro Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-nokia-c02-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Nokia C02 Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-honor-magic-6-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Honor Magic 6 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/tips-and-tricks-for-setting-up-your-poco-f5-5g-phone-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Poco F5 5G Phone Pattern Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-your-realme-gt-5s-potential-the-top-20-lock-screen-apps-you-need-to-try-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlock Your Realme GT 5s Potential The Top 20 Lock Screen Apps You Need to Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-honor-magic-6-pro-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Honor Magic 6 Pro Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-lock-screen-wallpaper-on-realme-gt-3-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Lock Screen Wallpaper on Realme GT 3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-poco-f5-pro-5g-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top Apps and Online Tools To Track Poco F5 Pro 5G Phone With/Without IMEI Number</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-realme-narzo-60-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Realme Narzo 60 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/5-solutions-for-oppo-reno-9a-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>5 Solutions For Oppo Reno 9A Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-poco-c50-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock a Poco C50 Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-poco-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Poco Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-can-we-unlock-our-realme-note-50-phone-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Can We Unlock Our Realme Note 50 Phone Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/universal-unlock-pattern-for-nokia-c02-by-drfone-android/"><u>Universal Unlock Pattern for Nokia C02</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-nokia-c12-plus-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Perfect Guide To Remove or Disable Google Smart Lock On Nokia C12 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-poco-f5-pro-5g-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Poco F5 Pro 5G Phone Pattern Lock without Factory Reset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-motorola-edge-40-neo-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Motorola Edge 40 Neo Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/delete-gmail-account-withwithout-password-on-oneplus-12r-by-drfone-android/"><u>Delete Gmail Account With/Without Password On OnePlus 12R</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-nokia-c210-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Forgot Pattern Lock?

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.</p><p>Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.</p><p>Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.</p><p><strong>Brute Force Password Cracking:</strong></p><p>Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.</p><p>A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" >dictionary attack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technique is normally used.</p><p>Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.</p><p><strong>GPU Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit. Before talking about GPU password cracking we must have some understanding about <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" >hashes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.</p><p>In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.</p><p>GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so that’s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.</p><p><strong>CUDA Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" >CUDA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.</p><p>CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.</p><p>We can easily access CUDA through libraries, directives and with the help of different programming languages that includes C, C++ and FORTRAN.</p><p><strong>Password Cracking Tools</strong></p><p>Given below is the list of Top10 Password cracking tools.</p><h2 id="1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows"><a href="#1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows" class="headerlink" title="1.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls.

Some methods might work without erasing your data, while others, like factory resetting, may erase all content from your phone.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6. Once you have been redirected to the ‘reset password’ page, you can input your new login information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637552475841.jpg"                      alt="android Google reset link"                ></p><p>7. Finally, you can unlock your Google account on your Android! Confirm this by clicking the “Change Password” button. Success!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637552534874.jpg"                      alt="android Google reset password input new password"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Locked-Screen-on-Android-using-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Locked-Screen-on-Android-using-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID. They fall back on a minimum 6-digit PIN (called Passcode in Apple world) to unlock in case the face does not get recognized in the first attempt.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten</h2><p>Just in case you set a hard pattern lock and promptly forgot that abstruse pattern you just set, we have a tool for you to quickly unlock your phone in case of a forgotten hard pattern lock: Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Remove the Hard Pattern Lock on Your OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G If You Forgot!</p><ul><li>Remove all Android screen locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face ID) in minutes.</li><li>Bypass the FRP lock of Samsung without a PIN or Google account.</li><li>Everyone can handle the lock screen without any tech knowledge.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,671</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Download the latest version of Dr.Fone from the Wondershare website and launch the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone app"                ></p><p>Step 1: Click Android under Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/select-your-mobile-device-to-unlock.png"                      alt="drfone android screen unlock"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click Unlock Android Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock android"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select your device manufacturer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-2.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock manufacturer selection"                ></p><p>Step 4: Prepare your device to unlock the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-android-screen-google.png"                      alt="wipe partition cache instructions"                ></p><p>When the greyed Next button becomes available, click it and wait for your device to be unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-6.png"                      alt="screen unlock successful"                ></p><p>All data on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device is wiped under this method.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the <strong>Root Explorer</strong> option and enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Get the passwords’ file.</p><p>Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named <strong>data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>When this folder opens, find another one named <strong>misc</strong>. Open it and find another one named <strong>wifi</strong>. Here, find a file named <strong>wpa_supplicant.conf</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android</p><p>Make sure that you don’t edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by <em>name (ssid&#x3D;”{the name}”)</em>, the network’s password represented by <em>psk</em>, the network’s access point represented by <em>key_mgmt&#x3D;WPA-PSK</em> and its priority represented by <em>priority</em>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root"></a>Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root</h2><p>What if I don’t have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root"><a href="#Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root"></a>Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root</h3><p>Step 1: Access the Developer authority</p><p>To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.</p><p>Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find “About phone.” Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Tap on this “build number” 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, “You are now a developer”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable the debugging.</p><p>Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for “Android&#x2F;USB debugging”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Install ADB drivers.</p><p>Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link <a class="link"   href="http://adbdriver.com/" >adbdriver.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from <a class="link"   href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790" >http://forum.xda-developers.com/... <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now open the folder where you’ve installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc <em>C\windows\system32\platform_tools</em> location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on”Open Command Window Here.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Test the ADB</p><p>Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly.

For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:</p><p>Tap on Settings, which is the gear symbol.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555171833750.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><ul><li>• Click on Personal and tap on Security.</li><li>• Go to Advanced and tap on Trust agents and make sure Smart Lock is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555174399892.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><ul><li>• Under Screen Security tap Smart Lock.</li><li>• Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock.

You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555176091774.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Turn-On-Smart-Lock-For-Android-with-Trusted-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-Turn-On-Smart-Lock-For-Android-with-Trusted-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices"></a>Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices</h2><p>You can decide on a trusted device to be paired with Smart Lock Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555177245258.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><p>For example, you can set up a Smart Lock for Bluetooth in your Android Bluetooth settings.

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device first.

Here’s how you can use this tool when you forget the phone password and want to recover it on your own.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your phone</strong></p><p>Installing Dr.Fone on your computer is the first step. From the list of available tools, select “Screen Unlock” from the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="open drfone and follow instructions"                ></p><p>When connecting your locked phone to the PC you wish to save the wallpapers after unlocking it, you should think about utilizing a USB cord. You must select the “Unlock Android Screen” option on the program.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen</strong></p><p>In this interface of Dr.Fone, please select “Unlock Android Screen” to keep your unlock process, or your phone cannot be unlocked as you wish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png"                      alt="select unlock android screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Select device model</strong></p><p>Besides a part of Samsung and LG models, “100% Remove Screen Lock” includes most Android phone brands. Please choose your phone brand, and don’t make it wrong!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-1.png"                      alt="select device model"                ></p><p>Here is the brand list; you can check it and find your phone brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-2.png"                      alt="check the brands list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.
