The service allows IT administrators to pre-configure settings and apps and manage other aspects of the Realme 12 Pro 5G device’s functionality. When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored. The administrators can push updates, track device locations, remotely wipe data for security, and enforce specific compliance policies.
