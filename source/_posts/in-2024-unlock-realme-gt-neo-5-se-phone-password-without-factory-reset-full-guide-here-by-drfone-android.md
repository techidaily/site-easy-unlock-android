## Method 1: Unlock Realme GT Neo 5 SE  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Realme GT Neo 5 SE  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Realme GT Neo 5 SE  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Realme GT Neo 5 SE  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
