## Method 3: Factory Reset Nokia C02  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Nokia C02  phone to allow users to erase the Nokia C02 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Nokia C02  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Nokia C02 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Nokia C02 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click Find A Lost Device.

**Step 4:** Select the Android device you want to wipe carefully if you have a few:

![erase phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-11.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Nokia C02  Phone

If your Nokia C02  phone is tied to a service contract and you want to unlock your device to use it with other service providers, this method is for you. You can request your service provider to unlock your Nokia C02  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

Sometimes, you may not need to secure your device at all. For example, if you have an old device that you want to use as a media player in your car or to give to children to play games, you may not want to password-protect the Nokia C02 device. This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

### Conclusion

There are a handful of methods you can use to unlock a Nokia C02  phone in case you forget the password or PIN or pattern. Especially for the old pattern-based screen locks, it is easy to unlock the phone if you know the answers to the security questions in your Google account. However, to unlock Nokia C02  phone screen without password on newer Android versions, you need technical knowledge, or you can use third-party software such as Wondershare Dr.Fone.
