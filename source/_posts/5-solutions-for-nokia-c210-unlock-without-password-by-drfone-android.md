## Part 1: Lock System About Nokia C210  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Nokia C210  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Nokia C210  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Nokia C210  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nokia C210  with Find My Device.
