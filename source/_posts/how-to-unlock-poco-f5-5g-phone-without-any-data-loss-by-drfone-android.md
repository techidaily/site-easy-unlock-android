## Part 1: How To Track Your Poco F5 5G on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

### Pros and Cons of IMEI Trackers: Apps and Online Platforms

Now that you know there are still methods to track a phone using an IMEI number, it's also important to weigh their pros and cons. See the list presented below:

**Pros**

- **Lost or Stolen Device Recovery.**The primary benefit of an IMEI tracker is its ability to help locate a lost or stolen mobile device. That can be crucial for recovering your valuable device.
- **No Need for Special Apps.**Unlike many other tracking methods, IMEI tracking doesn't require any special apps or software to be installed on the Poco F5 5G device you want to track. It relies on the unique IMEI number of the Poco F5 5G device.
- IMEI Tracker is compatible with many mobile devices, including smartphones and feature phones. It's not limited to a specific operating system or brand.

**Cons**

- **Internet and Network Dependency.**IMEI tracking depends on the Poco F5 5G device being connected to the internet or a mobile network. If the Poco F5 5G device is turned off, in airplane mode, or disconnected, tracking may be impossible.
- **Inaccuracies in Remote Areas.**IMEI tracking can be less accurate or even unavailable in remote or rural areas with poor network coverage.
