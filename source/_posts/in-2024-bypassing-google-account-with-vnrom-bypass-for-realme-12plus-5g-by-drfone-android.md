After removing the Realme 12+ 5G device from Knox Enrollment via the admin account, you may still need to uninstall the Knox app from the Android device. This can usually be done through the Realme 12+ 5G device’s settings. Navigate to ‘Apps’ in the settings menu, locate the Knox app, and select ‘Uninstall’ or ‘Disable’. Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Realme 12+ 5G device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Realme 12+ 5G device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesn’t include the Knox software.

However, this method is risky and not recommended for the average user. It will void your warranty and potentially ‘brick’ your device, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.

**Removing Knox Enrollment Service** from your phone is feasible but requires careful consideration, especially in a corporate context. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the risks of modifying your device’s software.
