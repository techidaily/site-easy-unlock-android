### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Poco F5 Pro 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Poco F5 Pro 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Poco F5 Pro 5G  .

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Poco F5 Pro 5G  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Poco F5 Pro 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Poco F5 Pro 5G  with the power button.
