Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.
