Step 6: Go to Fastboot folder on the PC and holding down the shift key, click on any empty space followed by a click on “Open command window here”.

Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter. Poco F5 Pro 5G  will show up in the command prompt.

Note: The drivers have to be installed correctly to see the Poco F5 Pro 5G device in the command prompt. So, if the Poco F5 Pro 5G device does not show up, reinstall HTC Sync Manager and try again after restarting the computer.

Step 8: On HTC Dev’s website third page, click on “proceed to Step 9”. Follow the steps listed and then click on submit. The unlock token code for the Poco F5 Pro 5G device will be mailed by HTC. Download the token and name it “Unlock\_code.bin” and place the token in the fastboot folder.

Step 9: Now, in the command prompt window, type the following:

fastboot flash unlocktoken Unlock\_code.bin

Step 10: On the Poco F5 Pro 5G , one message will appear asking if you want to unlock the Poco F5 Pro 5G device bootloader.
