## How to Unlock Poco X5  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Poco X5 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Poco X5  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Poco X5  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Poco X5 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Poco X5  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Poco X5  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

So, if you still want to unlock Poco X5  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Poco X5 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Poco X5 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Poco X5  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Poco X5 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Poco X5  device.

- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
- Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.
- Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data/Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.
