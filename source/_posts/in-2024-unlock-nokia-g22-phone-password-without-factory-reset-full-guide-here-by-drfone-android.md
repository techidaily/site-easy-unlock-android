Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Nokia G22  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Nokia G22  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Nokia G22  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

You can request your service provider to unlock your Nokia G22  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature.
