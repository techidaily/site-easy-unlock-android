## Part 3: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using Android Device Manager?

To make it easier for its users to locate, lock, or erase their devices remotely, Google has developed a dedicated feature of the Android Device Manager. It is also commonly known as “Find My Device” as it is mostly used to locate a lost (or stolen) device. Though you can use this feature to ring your device, lock it, unlock it, or erase it remotely.

All of this can be done by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Launch a web browser of any device and go to the Android Device Manager website by clicking right here: <https://www.google.com/android/find>.
