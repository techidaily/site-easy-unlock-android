Now, the question is, is it possible **to track an IMEI number through Google Earth**? This question has sparked much debate on the internet, so this article aims to find it out. Keep reading and learn the secrets of **Google Earth IMEI trackers**.

![google earth imei tracker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Track Your Poco C65 on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)
