However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Poco X5 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Poco X5 Pro  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Poco X5 Pro ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Poco X5 Pro device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Poco X5 Pro  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Poco X5 Pro :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Poco X5 Pro  device.
