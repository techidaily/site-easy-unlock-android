If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen.

- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

![setup android pattern lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg)
