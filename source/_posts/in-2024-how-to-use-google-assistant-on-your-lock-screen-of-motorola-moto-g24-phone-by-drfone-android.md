## Part 2. How To Use Google Assistant on Lock Screen

After you've successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.

- **Step 1:** Wake Up Google Assistant

Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

1. **Speak Clearly and Naturally**

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

2. **Use Simple and Direct Phrases**

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.
