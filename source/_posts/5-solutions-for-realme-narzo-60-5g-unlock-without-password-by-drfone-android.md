## Part 1: Lock System About Realme Narzo 60 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Realme Narzo 60 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Realme Narzo 60 5G  is one of the older versions of Realme  android phones that was released in 2016.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Realme Narzo 60 5G  Without Password or Pattern

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Realme Narzo 60 5G  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Realme  device using your Google Account.

![Realme Narzo 60 5G  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Realme Narzo 60 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Realme Narzo 60 5G  with the power button.
