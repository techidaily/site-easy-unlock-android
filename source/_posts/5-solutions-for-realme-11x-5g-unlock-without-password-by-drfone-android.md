Before we move towards the **Realme 11X 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Realme 11X 5G  Without Password or Pattern

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Realme 11X 5G  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools.

Here are the steps for **Realme 11X 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
