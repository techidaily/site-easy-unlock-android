You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

If you know your Google account password, then you can easily unlock your phone after verification. If you don't know the password, you can use a hard reset to erase all data and settings from your device. Use the [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) if you don't want to lose your data. Dr.Fone allows you to unlock your Poco X6  within minutes with easy-to-follow steps. It works for all old and new Poco  models, and the procedure is the same for every device. You can also use Dr.Fone to recover data, repair android software problems, and fix other issues.
