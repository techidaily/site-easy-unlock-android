## Part 1: Lock System About Poco C55  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Poco C55  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Poco C55  is one of the older versions of Poco  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Poco C55  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Poco C55  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Poco C55  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Poco C55  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.
- Disable the lock screen by tapping on the "Enable Lock Screen" button once.
- Enter your password or pattern and wait for the system to remove the screen lock.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Poco C55  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Poco C55  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Poco C55  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

- Make sure your phone is connected to the internet.
- Select the "Erase Device" option and log in with your Google account.
- After verification, click on "Ok" and wait for the system to factory reset.
- Power on your device and enter it without any pattern or password.

### 2: Google Account

Here is how you can do an **Poco C55  pattern unlock without PC**. You don't need any third-party software or device for this method. Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Poco  device using your Google Account.

![Poco C55  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

- Enter a random password or PIN on your phone's lock screen five times.
- Wait for the system to give the alert message after you enter the wrong password five times.
- Now, wait for 30 seconds until the system asks you to enter your lock screen password.
- At the bottom left corner, tap the “Forgotten Password” option.
- Now the system will ask for your Google account and password.
- After you verify your Google account, you can enter your device.

### 3: Answer Security Questions

If you want to unlock your Poco  phone, you can also answer some security questions and reset the password. This method does not work on all Poco  devices, but you can use it for **Poco C55  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Poco C55 device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Poco C55  with security questions.

![Poco C55  forgot pattern interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-03.jpg)

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Poco C55  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Poco C55  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)

- Press and hold the Volume down + Power buttons together for a few seconds. Hold the keys until you see the Poco  logo on the screen.

### 1\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Touched Firmly

#### Problem

If the fingerprint sensor fails to recognize your fingerprint, it might be due to inadequate pressure. This could also be due to improper finger placement on the sensor.

#### Solution: Firm Placement

Ensure you firmly place your finger on the sensor, covering it entirely. Avoid too much pressure, but make sure the sensor fully contacts your fingerprint.

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Poco C55 device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option. On the following screen, hit the "System update" option to check if any latest update is available. Here, if you see any updates, download and install them promptly.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Poco C55 device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.
