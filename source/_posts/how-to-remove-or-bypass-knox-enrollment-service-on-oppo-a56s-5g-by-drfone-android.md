When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored.

## Part 2: How To Remove Knox Enrollment Service on Your Oppo A56s 5G

In most cases, an administrator can only effectively **remove the Knox Enrollment Service** through the Samsung Knox Portal. This typically requires cooperation from your employer.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to removing itfrom the Admin’s Portal:

- **Step 1:** Sign in to the Samsung Knox Portal using administrative credentials.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment**, then click **Devices.**

![knox unenroll confirmation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-knox-enrollment-service-03.jpg)

After removing the Oppo A56s 5G device from Knox Enrollment via the admin account, you may still need to uninstall the Knox app from the Android device.

Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Oppo A56s 5G device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Oppo A56s 5G device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesn’t include the Knox software.

However, this method is risky and not recommended for the average user. It will void your warranty and potentially ‘brick’ your device, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.

**Removing Knox Enrollment Service** from your phone is feasible but requires careful consideration, especially in a corporate context. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the risks of modifying your device’s software.
