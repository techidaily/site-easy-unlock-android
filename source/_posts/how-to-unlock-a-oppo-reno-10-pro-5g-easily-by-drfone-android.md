## How to Unlock a Network Locked Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G Phone?

This scenario puts forward the need for **Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G network unlock** solutions.

There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G device, we can begin by pressing the "Lock" button.

After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G device.
