## How to Lock Apps on Nubia Z50 Ultra to Protect Your Individual Information

If you are not a fan of having to go through the process of getting through a [pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html) or password every time you want to use your phone, the good news is that you don’t have to. There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Nubia Z50 Ultra device as a whole.

Well, in light of helping you out, this article will address just how you can lock Apps on your device and not have to type in a code every time you want to use the Nubia Z50 Ultra device.

## Part 1. Why you need to Lock Apps on Android?

Before we get down to the business of locking some of your Apps, let’s look at some of the reasons why you would want to lock certain apps.

- You may simply want better access on your device. Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the Nubia Z50 Ultra device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.
- If you are a person who is not good at remembering passwords or patterns, simply locking certain apps will help you not get locked out of your entire device which can cause a lot of problems.
- If your device is used by more than one person, locking certain apps will keep the other users out of information you would rather they didn’t access.
- If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.
- Locking apps is also a good way to keep children from content they shouldn’t be accessing.

## Part 2. How to Lock Apps in Android

There is always a good reason to Lock Apps on your device and we have two easy and effective methods you can use to do this. Choose the one that you are most comfortable with.

### Method One: Using Smart App Protector

Smart App Protector is a freeware that allows you to lock specified applications.

Step 1: Download and Install Smart App Protector from the Google Play Store and Launch it. You may be required to install a helper application for Smart App Protector. This helper will ensure that the many App services running on your device will not be killed by third party apps.

Step 2: The default password 7777 but you can change this in the Password & Pattern Settings.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-01.jpg)

Step 3: The next step is to add apps to the Smart App Protector. Open the Running Tab on Smart Protector and tap on the “Add” button.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-02.jpg)

Step 3: Next, select the apps you would like to protect from the pop up list. Tap on the “Add” button once you have chosen your Apps.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-03.jpg)

Step 4: Now close the app and the Apps chosen will now be password protected.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-04.jpg)

### Method 2: Using Hexlock

Step 1: Download Hexlock from the Google Play Store. Once it is installed, open it. You will be required to enter a pattern or PIN. This is the lock code that you will use every time you open the app.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-05.png)

Step 2: Once the PIN or Password is set, you are now ready to lock apps. You can create multiple lists of Apps to be locked ba\_x\_sed on your different needs. As an example, we have chosen the Work panel. Tap on “Start Locking Apps” to start.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-06.jpg)

Step 3: You will see a list of Apps to choose from.  Choose the Apps you wish to lock and then Tap the down arrow in the upper left when you are done.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-07.jpg)

You can then Swipe to the left to move to other lists such as “Home” and proceed to lock apps in this group as well.

## Part 3. 6 Private Apps that you should lock on your Android

There are certain apps that may require to be locked more than others. Of course the choice of which apps you should lock will depend on your own uses and preferences. The following are some of the apps you would like to lock for one reason or another.

### 1\. The Messaging App

This is the application that allows you to send and receive messages. You may want to lock this app if you use your device to send messages of a sensitive nature that you would rather keep private. You may also want to lock this app if your device is used by more than one person and you don’t want other users reading your messages.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-08.jpg)

### 2\. Email App

Most people use individual email applications such as Yahoo Mail App or Gmail. This is another critical one if you are going to protect your work emails. You may want to lock the email app if your work emails are sensitive in nature and contain information that is not for all individuals.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-09.jpg)

### 3\. Google Play Services

This is the application that allows you to download and install applications to your device. You may want to lock this one if you are trying to prevent other users from downloading and installing further apps to your device. This is especially valuable if your device is utilized by children.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-10.jpg)

### 4\. Gallery App

The Gallery app displays all the images on your device. The main reason you may want to lock the Gallery app may be because you have sensitive images that are not suitable for all viewers. Again this is ideal if children make use of your device and you have images that you would rather they didn’t see.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-11.jpg)

### 5\. Music Pla\_x\_yer App

This is the Application that you use to play the music on your device. You may want to lock it if you don’t want anyone else making changes to your saved audio files and playlists or don’t want someone listening to your audio files.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-12.jpg)

### 6\. File Manager App

This is the App that displays all of the files that are saved on your device. It is the ultimate app to lock if you have sensitive information on your device that you would rather not share. Locking this app will ensure that all of the files on your device will remain safe from prying eyes.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-13.jpg)

Having the ability to lock your Apps is an easy way to keep information out of the limelight. It also allows you to take full control of your device. Try it, it might just be freeing as opposed to locking your entire device.

## How To Unlock Any Nubia Z50 Ultra Phone Password Using Emergency Call

Today, smartphones are an extension of people. Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.

But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.

That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.

![android emergency call screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg)

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

![android emergency screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.
