## Still Using Pattern Locks with Poco F5 Pro 5G? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice

They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an **easy pattern lock** of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.

![creating more secure pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

## Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks

The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.

### I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?

Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.

Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock/ screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.

Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were _easy_ to figure out by malicious actors.

### I.II: Popularity and Usage

Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.

There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.

### I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks

Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM/ credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware/ malware/ phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.

#### Advantages of Pattern Locks

There is no denying that using an **easy pattern lock** to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!

#### Disadvantages of Pattern Locks

While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!

What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!

## Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks

We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.

At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.

These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:

- \- shapes of alphabets,
- \- shapes of numerals,
- \- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.

Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.

![common pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.

- \- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.
- \- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.
- \- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.
- \- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.

The above data makes it amply clear how using an **easy pattern lock** is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.

## Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks

Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.

#### III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns

Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.

- \- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.
- \- Never use your first initial as a pattern.
- \- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.
- \- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.
- \- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point **easy pattern lock**!

#### III.II: Forgot Your Pattern? Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G Without Pattern Lock With Dr.Fone

Supercharged with the information above, you went ahead and changed your easy pattern lock to a hard-to-guess pattern lock. Only problem is, your brain is habituated to that old pattern, and you’ve suddenly forgotten what the new pattern was! Well, worry not; Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) will help you [unlock your phone without pattern lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html)!

## Solution 4: Unlock the Poco Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)

If your phone has a removable SD card, you can also try this technique to disable the pattern/password on your device. Though, you need to have some custom recovery installed on your device for this method. You can always go for TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) and flash it on your device.

TWRP: <https://twrp.me/>

Also, since you can't move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card. After ensuring that you have met all the basic prerequisites, follow these steps and learn how to unlock the Poco phone's forgotten password using a custom recovery.

## Solution 6: Unlock Poco Phone Using ADB Command (need USB debugging enabled)

This might be a little complicated initially, but if you don't want to follow either of the above-mentioned techniques to unlock your device, you can go with this alternative. Before proceeding, make sure that you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, then you can download Android SDK right [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

Additionally, it would help if you turned on the USB Debugging feature on your phone before you forgot the password. If USB debugging is not turned on before, then this method will not work for you.

After making your device ready and downloading all the essential software on your computer, follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Poco phone if you forgot the password.

- **Step 1.** Connect your device to the computer with a USB cable and open the command prompt when it is successfully connected. If you get a pop-up message regarding USB Debugging permission on your device, simply agree to it and continue.

- **Step 2.** Now, please provide the following code on the command prompt and reboot your device when it is processed. If you want, you can also tweak the code a little and provide a new lock pin.

- _ADB_ _shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.__db_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen__.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![unlock lg forgot password - command code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892205231542.jpg)

- **Step 3.** If the above code doesn't work, try providing the code “ADB _shell rm /data/system/gesture. the key_” to it and follow the same drill.

![unlock lg forgot password - code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892205424871.jpg)
