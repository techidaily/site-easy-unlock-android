We will explore conventional solutions that can address Pixel fingerprint problems. Each solution will also explain the underlying reasons for the **Pixel 6 fingerprint sensor** issue.

### 1\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Touched Firmly

#### Problem

If the fingerprint sensor fails to recognize your fingerprint, it might be due to inadequate pressure. This could also be due to improper finger placement on the sensor.

#### Solution: Firm Placement

Ensure you firmly place your finger on the sensor, covering it entirely. Avoid too much pressure, but make sure the sensor fully contacts your fingerprint.

![gently press fingerprint sensor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-5.jpg)

### 2\. Device Showing Glitches

#### Problem

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option. On the following screen, hit the "System update" option to check if any latest update is available. Here, if you see any updates, download and install them promptly.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

Use compressed air or a soft brush if there's visible debris or particles around the sensor. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure that might damage the sensor.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

There can be air bubbles trapped under the screen protector. If there are, gently press them out towards the edges using a card designed for this purpose.

**Step 2.** Here you will see three options: “Ring,” “Lock,” and “Erase.” Select the “Lock” option

**Step 3.** A window will appear where you need to type any temporary password. Do not enter your Google password, and you need not enter the recovery message. Click on “Lock ” again.

Once successful, you will get a confirmation message below the three buttons: Ring, Lock, and the Erase option.

**Step 4.** On your locked phone, you will see a field asking for your password. Here you can enter your temporary password. Doing so will unlock your device.

**Step 5.** Now in your unlocked phone, go to Settings and then to Security. Now click on disable to remove the temporary password, and later you change it with a new one.

You have successfully unlocked your device.

## Part 3: Unlock Android password using custom recovery and Pattern Password Disable (SD card needed)?

The third way to unlock an Android phone password without a factory reset it using the “custom recovery” technique. To work out this process, you would have to install the custom recovery process. Also, your phone needs to have an SD card. It will be required to send the zip file to the phone since your device is locked. This technique requires access to the Android System folder and rooting your device if not already rooted.

Custom recovery is a usual mechanism in all smartphones. It predicts the troubleshooting techniques and how to process the main configuration with all sequences. Quite interesting, isn’t it?

Follow the following steps to complete and unlock the Android password without a factory reset.

- **Step 1.** First of all, download a zip file by the name [“Pattern Password Disable”](https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) to the computer system and then transfer it to your SD card.
- **Step 2.** Then you would need to insert the SD card into your locked phone and then restart the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device in recovery mode.
- **Step 3.** Next, move on to flash on the zip files to the card and restart. After that, your phone will boot and open up without the locked screen.

_**Note**: Sometimes, the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device may ask for a pattern or password. You just need to put in any random pattern/password then it will get unlocked._

Through this easy method, you can now access your Android phone without using a factory reset and losing your valuable data.

The problem of getting your mobile locked and not being able to open it is a common problem on Android phones these days. Many of us tend to panic when such problems arise. However, now that we have given some easy solutions and methods to unlock Android phone passwords without factory reset and losing any data, things would be much easier.
