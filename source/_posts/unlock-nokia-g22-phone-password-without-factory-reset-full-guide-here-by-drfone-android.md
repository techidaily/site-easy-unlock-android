## Method 1: Unlock Nokia G22  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Nokia G22  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Nokia G22  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Nokia G22  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

**Step 2:** Next, choose the option to reset the pattern by answering your Google credentials.

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

You can request your service provider to unlock your Nokia G22  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.
