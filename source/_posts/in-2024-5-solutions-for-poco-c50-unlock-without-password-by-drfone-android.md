### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Poco C50  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Poco C50  is one of the older versions of Poco  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Poco C50  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Poco C50  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Poco C50  .

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Poco C50  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Poco C50  with Find My Device.
