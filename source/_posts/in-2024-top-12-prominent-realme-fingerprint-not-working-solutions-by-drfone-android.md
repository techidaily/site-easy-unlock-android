### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Realme 12 5G device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Realme 12 5G device.

## Part 3: How to Bypass Android Pattern When You Forgot It?

### 1\. Google Find My Device (For Android7.1.1 or later)

**Step 1.** Open the Android Device Manager site by typing [https://www.google.com/android/find](https://www.google.com/android/find) in an internet browser.

**Step 2.** You must give your Google ID credentials to sign in. Remember that this should be a similar Google account connected to your phone.

**Step 3.** After logging in, select your device.

**Step 4.** You will get three choices here, i.e., lock, erase, and ring.

**Step 5.** Click on the "Lock" button to reset its pattern.

**Step 6.** It will open another spring-up window. From here, you can give the new password to your phone.

**Step 7.** After affirming your PIN/password, you can give a recovery message and number (in case of theft only).

**Step 8.** Complete the process and sign out of your account on the browser.

### 2\. Forgot Pattern (For Android 4.4 or earlier)

**Step 1.** First and foremost, give some wrong patterns to your phone. It will tell you that you attempted the incorrect **pattern lock**.

**Step 2.** On a similar window, click the "Forgot pattern" choice on the base.

**Step 3.** That will open another screen, which you can use to sidestep the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the choice for entering the Google Account credentials and continue.

**Step 4.** To reset the **lock screen pattern**, you must give the correct details of the Google ID previously logged into the Realme 12 5G device.

**Step 5.** After giving the correct details, you can provide another pattern lock to the phone.

**Step 6.** Affirm your decision and set another **pattern lock** on your phone.

### 3\. Emergency Call Trick (For Android 5 or 5.1.1)

**Step 1:** Tap the Emergency Call button and enter ten asterisks (\*).

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the asterisks on the dialer until you no longer see the paste choice.

**Step 3:** Return to the lock screen and tap on the camera symbol.

**Step 4:** Press the settings choice on your Android gadget after pulling down the notification tray. Now you will have the chance to enter the PIN/password, and you ought to continue unlocking your Android phone. Continue to paste until the lock screen UI crashes.

### 4\. Safe Mode Boot (For Android 4.1 or later)

**Step 1:** You can bring up the power menu and hold the "Power Off" button for most phones, especially Android phones. A warning will spring up, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Here, it would help if you had to press Ok.

![reboot to safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Clear your lock screen application's data.

Clean data off your lock screen app, uninstall it, and then reboot your device to escape safe mode. When you do so, your phone or Android device will unlock.

### 5\. Use ADB (USB required for Android 10 and lower)

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases

sqlite3 settings.db

update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';

update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';

.quit

exit

adb reboot

- After your gadget has rebooted, enter the command below:

adb shell

rm/data/framework/gesture.key

exit

adb reboot

- Your phone will reboot. After it reboots and requests a security pattern, you can utilize any pattern, and it will unlock.
