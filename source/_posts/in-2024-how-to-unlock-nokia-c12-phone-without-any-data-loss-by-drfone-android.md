**Here is the step-by-step guide for you to follow**

**Step 1.** Go to [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://androidmtk.com/download-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-tool) download page.

![Minimal adb and fastboot dowload page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313491726.jpg)

**Step 2.** Download the tool's latest version.

**Step 3.** Open the downloaded Minimal ADB and Fastbootzip file and install it.

![Minimal adb and fastboot installer zip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313544528.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot setup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313551732.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Nokia C12 and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

## Part 3: Other ways to Unlock Pattern for Android

There are other ways to unlock the **universal unlock patterns** for Android. We have mentioned some of them below.

The first method is ADB, which stands for Android Debug Bridge. With the help of this, you can unlock your Android's **[universal unlock pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode.html)** without the need of a factory reset. However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

**Step 1**: Open your PC and head to [Android Developer's site](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html). Download ADB now.

**Step 2**: Launch it now and install the packages on your PC.

![unlock android screen 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/adb-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: Connect your Android to PC now. Before that, make sure to enable USB Debugging. If you don't know-how, simply head to the "Settings"> “About Phone” and tap on “Build Number” 7 times. This will enable the Developer's Options.

![unlock android screen 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/adb-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: Now go to the Developer Options menu and turn on the USB Debugging.

In regular mode, restart the phone. The pattern will be requested. However, any pattern will unlock the screen.

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

It's one of the most straightforward ways to get past the lock screen. One thing to note is that this method is effective only if the lock screen is a third-party app rather than the standard one.

### Way 3: Unlock Pattern Lock via Factory Reset

**Step 4**: The phone will perform the factory reset. In a short while, restart your device and there will be no lock screen.

### Way 4: Unlock Pattern Lock with Android Device Manager

Android Device Manager unlocking is the second-best service for bypassing the Android lock screen on locked Android devices and tablets. Working on this service is quite straightforward, and it only works if the user has a Google account. This service is accessible and usable from any device or computer.

![unlock android screen 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-1.jpg)

There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Nokia C12 device, we can begin by pressing the "Lock" button.

After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Nokia C12 device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]

If you use an older Android version, you can get rid of the **universal unlock pattern** by forgot pattern feature. On earlier Android devices, this feature is enabled by default. After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.

**Step 1**: Simply enter wrong pattern too many times until try again in 30 seconds warning comes.

**Step 2**: Select the "Forgot Pattern" option below the message.
