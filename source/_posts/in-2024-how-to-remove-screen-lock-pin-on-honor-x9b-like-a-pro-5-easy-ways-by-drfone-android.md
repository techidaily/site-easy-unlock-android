## How to Remove Operator Lock on Honor X9b ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider.

If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Honor X9b  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Honor X9b :
