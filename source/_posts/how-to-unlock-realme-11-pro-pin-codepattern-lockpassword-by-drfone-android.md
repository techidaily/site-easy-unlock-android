You can unlock your Realme 11 Pro  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Realme 11 Pro ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Realme 11 Pro device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Realme 11 Pro  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Realme 11 Pro :

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Realme 11 Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
