- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none.

- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

## Part 3: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using Android Device Manager?

To make it easier for its users to locate, lock, or erase their devices remotely, Google has developed a dedicated feature of the Android Device Manager. It is also commonly known as “Find My Device” as it is mostly used to locate a lost (or stolen) device. Though you can use this feature to ring your device, lock it, unlock it, or erase it remotely.

All of this can be done by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Launch a web browser of any device and go to the Android Device Manager website by clicking right here: <https://www.google.com/android/find>.

**Step 1:** Turn off your Samsung device and connect it to your computer. Now press and hold “Volume Up” and “Power” keys for a while. Release the keys once the Motorola Moto G34 5G device enters Recovery Mode.

**Step 2:** In Recovery Mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to “Wipe data/factory reset” and select it with the “Power” key. Confirm the action on the next screen by selecting “Factory data reset.”
