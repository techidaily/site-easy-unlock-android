You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Poco X5 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Poco X5 Pro  .

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Poco X5 Pro  with Find My Device.
