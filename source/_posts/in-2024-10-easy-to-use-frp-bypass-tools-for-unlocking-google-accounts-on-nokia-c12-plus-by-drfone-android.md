## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Nokia C12 Plus?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

![setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg)

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Nokia C12 Plus device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 7\. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.
- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

![setup android pattern lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg)

## Part 2: How to unlock the Android phone pattern lock without resetting using a Google account?

If you have an older Android device, then you can simply move past its lock by taking the assistance of your Google account. All you need is access to the same Google account that is linked to your device. Though, this technique will only work on devices running on Android 4.4 and earlier versions. To learn how to remove pattern lock on Android without a factory reset, follow these steps:

Step 1. Simply provide any pattern on the Nokia C12 Plus device. Since the pattern would be wrong, you will get the following prompt.

Step 2. Tap on the “**Forgot Pattern**” option located at the bottom of the screen.

After following these instructions, you would be able to learn how to unlock an Android phone pattern lock without factory reset or causing any harm to your device.

## Part 3: How to unlock Android phone password without factory reset - Android Device Manager

The Android Device Manager, which is now known as “Find My Device” is one of the best ways to locate your Android device remotely. Besides that, you can also use the interface to ring your device or change its lock from anywhere. All you need to do is access its interface from any other device and log-in with your Google credentials. You can follow these steps to learn how to unlock the Android pattern lock without factory reset.

Step 1. Log in to Android Device Manager (Find My Device) using your Google credentials.

Android Device Manager website: <https://www.google.com/android/find>.

Step 2. From the interface, you can select the Android device that is linked to your Google account.

Step 3. You will get options to ring it, lock it, or erase it. Select the “Lock” option to proceed.

Step 4. This will launch a new pop-up window. From here, you can provide a new lock screen password, confirm it, and also set an optional recovery message or phone number (in case your device has been lost).

## Part 4: How to unlock Android phone pattern lock without factory reset using ADB?

Step 1. To start with, you need to download ADB on your system. This can be done by visiting the Android Developer’s website <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html>.

Step 2. Afterward, launch the installer and download all the essential packages on your system.

Step 3. Now, connect your phone to the system. Make sure that its USB debugging feature is on.

Step 4. To do this, go to Settings > About Phone and tap the “**Build Number**” option seven consecutive times. This will enable the Developer Options on your device.

Step 5. Go to Settings > Developer Options and turn on the feature of USB debugging.
