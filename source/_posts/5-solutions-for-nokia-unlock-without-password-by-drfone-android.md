## Part 1: Lock System About Nokia 105 Classic  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Nokia 105 Classic  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Nokia 105 Classic  is one of the older versions of Nokia  android phones that was released in 2016.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Nokia 105 Classic  with its privacy password settings.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Nokia 105 Classic  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nokia 105 Classic  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Nokia  device using your Google Account.

![Nokia 105 Classic  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Nokia 105 Classic  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Nokia 105 Classic  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Nokia 105 Classic  with the power button.

## Part 3: A Comprehensive Comparison: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) vs. Android Multi Tool

Well, you have come to know great things about the two pattern lock remover tools: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock and Android Multi Tool.

Now, take a look at these tools' comparison.

| **Features** | **Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) ![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)**  | **Android Multi Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlock pattern locks without deleting data | Yes | Yes |
| Easy to use | Yes | Technical skills required. |
| High-success Rate | Yes | This tool may sometimes not work.  |

One of the standout features of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is its simplicity. The software is designed to be easy to use, even for those with little technical knowledge.

One key advantage of Android Multi Tool is its compatibility with a wide range of Android devices. However, it's worth noting that due to its open-source nature, Android Multi Tool may not receive regular updates and bug fixes, which could potentially lead to compatibility issues with newer Android versions.

In terms of customer support, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) excels.
