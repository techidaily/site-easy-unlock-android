## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
