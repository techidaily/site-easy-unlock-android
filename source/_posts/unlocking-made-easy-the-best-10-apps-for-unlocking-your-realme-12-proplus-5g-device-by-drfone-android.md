## How to Remove Operator Lock on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Realme 12 Pro+ 5G :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
