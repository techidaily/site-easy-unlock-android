## Part 1: Lock System About Realme GT Neo 5 SE  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Realme GT Neo 5 SE  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Realme GT Neo 5 SE  is one of the older versions of Realme  android phones that was released in 2016.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Realme GT Neo 5 SE  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Realme GT Neo 5 SE  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Realme GT Neo 5 SE  with the power button.
