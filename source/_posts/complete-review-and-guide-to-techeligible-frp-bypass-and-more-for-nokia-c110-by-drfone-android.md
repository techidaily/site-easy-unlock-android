Installing Dr.Fone on your computer is the first step. From the list of available tools, select "Screen Unlock" from the drop-down menu.

![open drfone and follow instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

When connecting your locked phone to the PC you wish to save the wallpapers after unlocking it, you should think about utilizing a USB cord. You must select the "Unlock Android Screen" option on the program.

**Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen**

In this interface of Dr.Fone, please select “Unlock Android Screen” to keep your unlock process, or your phone cannot be unlocked as you wish.

**Step 3. Select device model**

Besides a part of Samsung and LG models, "100% Remove Screen Lock" includes most Android phone brands. Please choose your phone brand, and don’t make it wrong!

**Step 4. Enter into Recovery Mode**

Then follow the instructions on the program to get the Android phone into Recovery Mode. Here we take 3 different models of Samsung phones as examples.

Note: Different brands have different steps to enter the Recovery Mode.

**Go to the Recovery Mode on Samsung phone with Bixby**
