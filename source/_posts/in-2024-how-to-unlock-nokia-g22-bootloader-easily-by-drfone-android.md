Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 2:** If the bootloader status displays "Yes," ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlocking" on your smartphone and switch it off.

**Step 3:** Connect the Nokia G22  smartphone with a USB cable and press the "Power + Volume Up" keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the "Devices and Printers" directory. Right-click on the "fastboot driver" file, select "Update," and select the location of the "android\_winbus.inf" file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`

Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: `fastboot reboot`

## Conclusion

Forgetting your Nokia G22  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common. For such instances, there are several methods that you can use to unlock your screen, 5 of which we have discussed in this article.

If you’re looking for ways that are time-effective and reliable, you can use your Google account or other ways to unlock Nokia G22  and set a new screen lock. However, with these methods, you can lose your data, so we only recommend using them if your device is backed up.
