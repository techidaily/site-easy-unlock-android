Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Poco X5 device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

## Part 2: How to unlock the Android phone pattern lock without resetting using a Google account?

If you have an older Android device, then you can simply move past its lock by taking the assistance of your Google account. All you need is access to the same Google account that is linked to your device. Though, this technique will only work on devices running on Android 4.4 and earlier versions. To learn how to remove pattern lock on Android without a factory reset, follow these steps:

Step 1. Simply provide any pattern on the Poco X5 device. Since the pattern would be wrong, you will get the following prompt.

Step 2. Tap on the “**Forgot Pattern**” option located at the bottom of the screen.

After following these instructions, you would be able to learn how to unlock an Android phone pattern lock without factory reset or causing any harm to your device.

## Part 3: How to unlock Android phone password without factory reset - Android Device Manager

The Android Device Manager, which is now known as “Find My Device” is one of the best ways to locate your Android device remotely. Besides that, you can also use the interface to ring your device or change its lock from anywhere. All you need to do is access its interface from any other device and log-in with your Google credentials. You can follow these steps to learn how to unlock the Android pattern lock without factory reset.

Step 1. Log in to Android Device Manager (Find My Device) using your Google credentials.

Step 2. From the interface, you can select the Android device that is linked to your Google account.

![lock android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057364556808.jpg)

Step 3. You will get options to ring it, lock it, or erase it. Select the “Lock” option to proceed.

Step 4. This will launch a new pop-up window. From here, you can provide a new lock screen password, confirm it, and also set an optional recovery message or phone number (in case your device has been lost).

![set new lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057364746547.jpg)

## Part 4: How to unlock Android phone pattern lock without factory reset using ADB?

Step 1. To start with, you need to download ADB on your system. This can be done by visiting the Android Developer’s website <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html>.

Step 3. Now, connect your phone to the system. Make sure that its USB debugging feature is on.

Step 4. To do this, go to Settings > About Phone and tap the “**Build Number**” option seven consecutive times. This will enable the Developer Options on your device.

Step 5. Go to Settings > Developer Options and turn on the feature of USB debugging.
