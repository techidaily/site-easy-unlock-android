### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Honor X9b  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Honor X9b  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Honor X9b  .

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Honor X9b  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools.

Here are the steps for **Honor X9b  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Honor X9b  with the power button.
