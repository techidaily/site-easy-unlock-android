## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Nokia C32 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Nokia C32 device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

After you've successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.

- **Step 1:** Wake Up Google Assistant

Start by waking up Google Assistant. You can do this by saying the wake word "Hey Google" or "OK Google." If it doesn’t work, you can long-press the home button or use any dedicated gesture to activate Google Assistant.

- **Step 2:** Issue a Voice Command

Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

"Hey Google, what's the weather today?"
