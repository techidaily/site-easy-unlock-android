- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Nokia G42 5G device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.

## Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?

Just act according to the following steps, and the Android Device Manager will unlock your phone.

1\. On your computer or any other mobile phone, visit: google.com/android/devicemanager

2\. Then, sign in with the help of your Google login details that you had used in your locked phone as well.

3\. In the ADM interface, choose the Nokia G42 5G device you want to unlock. Now, select “Lock”.

4\. Enter a temporary password. Now go ahead and click on “Lock” again.

5\. If the previous step was successful, you should be seeing a confirmation below the box with the buttons – Ring, Lock and Erase.

6\. Now, you should see a password field on your phone screen. Enter a temporary password to unlock your phone.

7\. Visit your phone’s lock screen settings and disable the temporary password.

The Android Device Manager has successfully unlocked your phone!

A downside to this process, is an error message faced by some users while using ADM. Many users have reported the issue, that when they have tried using ADM to unlock their locked device, an error message has occurred, saying, “since Google has verified that a screen lock is already set”. Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Google’s part, not your phone’s.

## Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager

There are 2 situations where you would want to know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock – one, when you have unfortunately forgotten the screen lock passcode and the other is when your phone is locked by Android Device Manager.

ADM is built to completely lock your device so that unknown people cannot access it. So, if your phone is locked by Android Device Manager, you might be in a problem.While ADM is a wonderful tool to lock your phone or erase and wipe data if its stolen or lost, most of the users have reported the issue that they cannot unlock their phones that are locked by Android Device Manager. A possible solution to this is adding a temporary password via Google login and bypassing the ADM lock. Or, you can try resetting the password again by entering a new password via ADM. If that does not work, you can make use of several third-party applications which can be found in the internet, that will help to completely erase the Android Device Manager lock.

So, now you know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock. Do keep in mind, your device must be connected to internet or Wi-Fi, to login to your Google account.

## Part 4: Unlock Android devices with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)

As mentioned before, many were unable to unlock their phones with ADM. This is why we use the [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/).

Phones are probably one of the most important belongings of ours, in which we confide all our private and confidential documents that we wouldn’t want to be meddled with.
