One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Nokia XR21 device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Nokia XR21 device.

Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Nokia XR21 device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Nokia XR21 device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively.
