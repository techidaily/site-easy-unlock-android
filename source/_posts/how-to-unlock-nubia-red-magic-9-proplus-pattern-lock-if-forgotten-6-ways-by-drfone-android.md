However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
