## Part 1: Lock System About Realme GT 5 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Realme GT 5 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Realme GT 5 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Realme GT 5 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Realme GT 5 Pro  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Realme GT 5 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Realme GT 5 Pro  with the power button.
