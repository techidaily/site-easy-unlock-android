## Part 1: Lock System About Oppo A56s 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Oppo A56s 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Oppo A56s 5G  is one of the older versions of Oppo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Oppo A56s 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Oppo A56s 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Oppo A56s 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

- Enter your password or pattern and wait for the system to remove the screen lock.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Oppo A56s 5G  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Oppo A56s 5G  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Oppo A56s 5G  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

### 2: Google Account

Here is how you can do an **Oppo A56s 5G  pattern unlock without PC**. You don't need any third-party software or device for this method. Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Oppo  device using your Google Account.

![Oppo A56s 5G  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

- Enter a random password or PIN on your phone's lock screen five times.
- Wait for the system to give the alert message after you enter the wrong password five times.
- Now, wait for 30 seconds until the system asks you to enter your lock screen password.
- At the bottom left corner, tap the “Forgotten Password” option.
- Now the system will ask for your Google account and password.
- After you verify your Google account, you can enter your device.

### 3: Answer Security Questions

This method does not work on all Oppo  devices, but you can use it for **Oppo A56s 5G  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Oppo A56s 5G device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Oppo A56s 5G  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Oppo A56s 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Oppo A56s 5G  with the power button.
