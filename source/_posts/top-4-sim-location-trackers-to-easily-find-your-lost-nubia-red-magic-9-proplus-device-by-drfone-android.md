Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?

Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.

![face lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg)

## How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?

If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.

### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.

![android hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg)

**Step 1**: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.

**Step 2**: Select the Wipe data/Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.

**Step 3**: Choose Yes > Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.

So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.

### 3\. Google Find My Device

Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won't be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:

![google find my device data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.

**Step 2:** Your phone receives a notification.

**Step 3:** Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.

**Step 4:** The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it's finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.

Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.

## Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+

## **What is password cracking?**

Password cracking process involves recovering a password from storage locations or from data, transmitted by a computer system on network. Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.

Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.

Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.

**Brute Force Password Cracking:**

Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically itâ€™s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.

A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organizationâ€™s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords [dictionary attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack) technique is normally used.

Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.

When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.

In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.

GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so thatâ€™s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.

**CUDA Password Cracking:**

[CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.

CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.
