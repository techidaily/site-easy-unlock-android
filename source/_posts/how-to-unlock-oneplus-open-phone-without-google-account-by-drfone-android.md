## How to Unlock OnePlus Open Phone without Google Account?

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For OnePlus Open 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the OnePlus Open device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).
