## Part 1: How To Track Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.
- **Step 4:** Launch Google Earth on your computer or mobile device, then select **Your timeline** from the Google Maps menu. The operation will take you to the Google Maps Timeline page.

![your timeline on google maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-04.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Select the day you wish to see the phone's location history. Choose the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

![google maps location history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-05.jpg)

## Part 2: Google Earth Alternatives: Track Phone Using IMEI Number

Now that you know the truth behind **tracking an IMEI number through Google Earth**, let's talk about other ways to track your phone using your IMEI number. This section will discuss some of your other options when it comes to IMEI number location tracking.

**Step 7:** When all is done, you will see the following:

![motorola phone screen unlock process complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-6.png)

Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone screen is now unlocked. Click the button below to unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone password without factory reset now!


## Method 3: Factory Reset Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone to allow users to erase the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Google Find My Device is an online service by Google that is used to locate and track your Android devices. It works like how Apple's Find My works for its range of hardware. Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click Find A Lost Device.

**Step 4:** Select the Android device you want to wipe carefully if you have a few:

![erase phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-11.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  Phone

If your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone is tied to a service contract and you want to unlock your device to use it with other service providers, this method is for you. You can request your service provider to unlock your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

Sometimes, you may not need to secure your device at all. For example, if you have an old device that you want to use as a media player in your car or to give to children to play games, you may not want to password-protect the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

### Conclusion

There are a handful of methods you can use to unlock a Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone in case you forget the password or PIN or pattern. Especially for the old pattern-based screen locks, it is easy to unlock the phone if you know the answers to the security questions in your Google account. However, to unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone screen without password on newer Android versions, you need technical knowledge, or you can use third-party software such as Wondershare Dr.Fone. Using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock, you can unlock your phone quickly with no technical mumbo jumbo to confuse you. All you will get is a software that guides you every step of the way so you can unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  phone easily.
