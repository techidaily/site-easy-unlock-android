## Part 1: Lock System About Nubia Z50S Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Nubia Z50S Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nubia Z50S Pro  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Nubia Z50S Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Nubia Z50S Pro  with the power button.
