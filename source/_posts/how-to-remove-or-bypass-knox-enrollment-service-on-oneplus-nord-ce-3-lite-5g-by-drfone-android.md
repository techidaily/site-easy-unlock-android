In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.
