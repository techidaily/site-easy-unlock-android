## Part 1: How To Track Your Oppo Find X6 on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.

![your timeline on google maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-04.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Select the day you wish to see the phone's location history. Choose the Oppo Find X6 device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

![google maps location history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-05.jpg)

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches.

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Oppo Find X6 device.

### 10\. Other Hardware Issues

#### Problem

Persistent fingerprint sensor problems might indicate underlying [hardware issues](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/best-apps-for-android-hardware-test.html). This could go beyond common troubleshooting and might require professional help.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Inspect for Physical Damage

Thoroughly examine your Pixel device for any physical damage. These include cracks, dents, or scratches around the fingerprint sensor area. Physical damage could affect the sensor's functionality.

##### 2\. Safe Mode Check

Boot the Oppo Find X6 device in safe mode to determine if third-party apps are causing conflicts. To do that, press the "Power" key with any volume key to access the power menu. Afterward, long-press the "Power Off" option until the "Reboot to Safe Mode" option appears on your device's screen. Press "OK" to reboot into Safe Mode and test the fingerprint sensor's functionality.

##### 3\. Professional Assessment

If you suspect hardware issues, seek professional help from authorized service centers. A clear sign of hardware issues can be visible damage or the sensor failing to function even in safe mode.

### 11\. Factory Reset as Last Resort

#### Problem

Did all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve persistent fingerprint sensor issues? Then, a [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/android-factory-reset-code.html) might be required to revert the Oppo Find X6 device to its original settings.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Backup Data

Use Google's backup services or third-party apps to securely [back up your data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

##### 2\. Initiating Factory Reset

Proceed with the following steps to execute a factory reset on your Pixel device:
