The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Realme C53 device. Once you set up the Realme C53 device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Realme C53 device as soon as it recognizes you.

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Realme C53 device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Realme C53 device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.
