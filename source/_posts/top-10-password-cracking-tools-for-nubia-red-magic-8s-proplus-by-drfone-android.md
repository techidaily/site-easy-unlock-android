## Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+

## **What is password cracking?**

Password cracking process involves recovering a password from storage locations or from data, transmitted by a computer system on network. Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.

Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.

Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.

**Brute Force Password Cracking:**

Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.

A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords [dictionary attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack) technique is normally used.

Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.

**GPU Password Cracking:**

[GPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit. Before talking about GPU password cracking we must have some understanding about [hashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function). When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.

In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.

GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so that’s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.

**CUDA Password Cracking:**

[CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.

CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.

## 1\. How to Unlock Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  With Google Find My Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+?

A way to unlock the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

For this method, you need a PC and your Google account details. Here are the steps for it:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  phone.

**Step 3:** It will show you 3 options: Play Sound, Secure Device, and Erase Device.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-find-my-device.jpg)

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

![select erase data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/select-erase-device.jpg)

Selecting this option will erase all content from your device, including screen unlock PIN, password, and pattern.

**Step 4:** Now, you can access your phone without an unlock PIN or pattern and set a new one.

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

## How to Unlock Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  with Google Account?

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device and its password.

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

So, if you still want to unlock Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

- **Step 1:** Power off your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  device.

![enter the sim unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-7.jpg)

## Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?

Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 2:** If the bootloader status displays "Yes," ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlocking" on your smartphone and switch it off.

**Step 3:** Connect the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+  smartphone with a USB cable and press the "Power + Volume Up" keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the "Devices and Printers" directory. Right-click on the "fastboot driver" file, select "Update," and select the location of the "android\_winbus.inf" file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`

Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: `fastboot reboot`
