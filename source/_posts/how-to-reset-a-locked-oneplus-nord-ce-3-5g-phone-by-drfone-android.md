You may also want to lock this app if your device is used by more than one person and you don’t want other users reading your messages.

### 4\. Gallery App

The Gallery app displays all the images on your device. The main reason you may want to lock the Gallery app may be because you have sensitive images that are not suitable for all viewers.

### 5\. Music Pla\_x\_yer App
