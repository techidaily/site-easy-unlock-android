The service allows IT administrators to pre-configure settings and apps and manage other aspects of the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device’s functionality. When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored. The administrators can push updates, track device locations, remotely wipe data for security, and enforce specific compliance policies. This automation of device enrollment simplifies the setup process for both the IT department and the end-user.

Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.
