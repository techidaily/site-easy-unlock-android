![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.
