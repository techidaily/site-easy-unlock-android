Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.

2. **Limited context understanding**

While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.

1. **Speak Clearly and Naturally**

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

2. **Use Simple and Direct Phrases**

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.

Ensure that your device's microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone's microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.

Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.

Installing Dr.Fone on your computer is the first step. From the list of available tools, select "Screen Unlock" from the drop-down menu.

![open drfone and follow instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

When connecting your locked phone to the PC you wish to save the wallpapers after unlocking it, you should think about utilizing a USB cord. You must select the "Unlock Android Screen" option on the program.

**Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen**

In this interface of Dr.Fone, please select “Unlock Android Screen” to keep your unlock process, or your phone cannot be unlocked as you wish.

**Step 3. Select device model**

Besides a part of Samsung and LG models, "100% Remove Screen Lock" includes most Android phone brands. Please choose your phone brand, and don’t make it wrong!

**Step 4. Enter into Recovery Mode**

Then follow the instructions on the program to get the Android phone into Recovery Mode. Here we take 3 different models of Samsung phones as examples.

Note: Different brands have different steps to enter the Recovery Mode.

**Go to the Recovery Mode on Samsung phone with Bixby**
