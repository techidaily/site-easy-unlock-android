Before we move towards the **Realme Note 50  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Realme Note 50  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Realme Note 50  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Realme Note 50  with the power button.
