## Part 1: Lock System About Oppo K11x  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Oppo K11x  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Oppo K11x  is one of the older versions of Oppo  android phones that was released in 2016.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Oppo K11x  with its privacy password settings.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Oppo K11x  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Oppo  device using your Google Account.

You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Oppo K11x device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Oppo K11x  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Oppo K11x  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Oppo K11x  with the power button.
