Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nubia Z50S Pro  with Find My Device.

The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Nubia Z50S Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Nubia Z50S Pro  with the power button.
