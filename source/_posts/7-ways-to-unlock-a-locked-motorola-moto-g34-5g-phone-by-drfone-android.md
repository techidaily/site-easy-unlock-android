5\. When the recovery package download is completed, Dr.Fone toolkit will begin removing the screen lock. This process will not cause any data loss on your Android device, so do not worry. Once the whole procedure is over, you can easily access your Android phone without entering any kind of password. Hurrah!

The Dr.Fone software is currently compatible with Samsung Galaxy S/Note/Tab series, and LG G2/G3/G4 series. For windows, it is compatible with 10/8.1/8/7/XP/Vista.

The Android Device Manager is an excellent initiative taken by Google to give people the chance to not lose any data and regain access to their phones. This also teaches us to take precautions before such unfortunate incidents take place. Phones are probably one of the most important belongings of ours, in which we confide all our private and confidential documents that we wouldn’t want to be meddled with.

So, make use of this guide and get back command over your Android phone.
