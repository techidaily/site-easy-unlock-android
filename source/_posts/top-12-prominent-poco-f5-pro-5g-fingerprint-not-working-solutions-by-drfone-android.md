We will explore conventional solutions that can address Pixel fingerprint problems. Each solution will also explain the underlying reasons for the **Pixel 6 fingerprint sensor** issue.

### 1\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Touched Firmly

#### Problem

If the fingerprint sensor fails to recognize your fingerprint, it might be due to inadequate pressure. This could also be due to improper finger placement on the sensor.

#### Solution: Firm Placement

Ensure you firmly place your finger on the sensor, covering it entirely. Avoid too much pressure, but make sure the sensor fully contacts your fingerprint.

![gently press fingerprint sensor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-5.jpg)

### 2\. Device Showing Glitches

#### Problem

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Poco F5 Pro 5G device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option. On the following screen, hit the "System update" option to check if any latest update is available. Here, if you see any updates, download and install them promptly. Before initiating the update, ensure your device is connected to a stable Wi-Fi network with sufficient battery charge.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Poco F5 Pro 5G device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

Use compressed air or a soft brush if there's visible debris or particles around the sensor. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure that might damage the sensor.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

##### 4\. Remove Air Bubbles

There can be air bubbles trapped under the screen protector. If there are, gently press them out towards the edges using a card designed for this purpose.

![protector screen dirty or damaged](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-9.jpg)

### 6\. Clean Your Finger

#### Problem

The problem may lie with your fingers rather than the Poco F5 Pro 5G device. Unclean or moist fingers can hinder accurate fingerprint recognition on the sensor, causing **the Poco F5 Pro 5G fingerprint sensor to not work**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands. Additionally, verify that your fingers are entirely dry before engaging the sensor. The reason is any moisture or dampness may cause inaccuracies in fingerprint identification.

##### 2\. Avoid Oily or Greasy Substances

Refrain from touching oily or greasy surfaces before using the fingerprint sensor. These substances can transfer onto your fingers, affecting sensor accuracy. If your fingers are dirty or damp, pause to clean them using a dry, clean cloth.

![cleaning finger to use fingerprint](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-10.jpg)

### 7\. Covering Screen if Fingerprint on Screen

#### Problem

Fingerprint marks or smudges on the screen might disrupt sensor functionality. This leads to inaccurate recognition when you try to unlock your device.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Avoid Covering the Sensor Area

Be cautious while cleaning the screen to avoid covering or smudging the area around the fingerprint sensor. Precise cleaning around this area prevents interference with sensor functionality.

##### 2\. Use Proper Holding Technique

While holding the Poco F5 Pro 5G device, avoid placing your fingers or palms over the fingerprint sensor. Opt for holding the Poco F5 Pro 5G device to minimize accidental contact with the sensor area.

![hold phone properly](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-11.jpg)

### 8\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Visible

#### Problem

Misconfigured settings on your Pixel device can lead to situations where the fingerprint sensor is not visible. It can lead to scenarios where the Poco F5 Pro 5G device fails to recognize your screen unlocking attempt.

#### Solution: Adjust the Setting To Consistently Display the Sensor

You must adjust the display settings to ensure the fingerprint sensor is always visible. To do that, you can begin by opening the Settings app. Navigate to the "Display" tab and select "Lock Screen." On the following window, toggle on "Always show time and info."

![put sensor to always display](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-12.jpg)

### 9\. Low Touch Sensitivity

#### Problem

The fingerprint sensor may have [low touch sensitivity](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/google-pixel-4a-touch-screen-not-working.html). It can lead to difficulties in accurately recognizing fingerprints, leading to **Poco F5 Pro 5G fingerprint not working**.

![turn on screen protector mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-13.jpg)

##### 2\. Finger Re-Enrollment

- **Step 1.** In the Settings app of your Pixel, tap "Security & Privacy." Then, press "Device Unlock" and choose "Fingerprint Unlock." The device will now ask you to provide your device PIN or password.
