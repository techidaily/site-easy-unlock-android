## Method 1: Unlock Poco C51  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Poco C51  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Poco C51  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Poco C51  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

There is a standard factory reset built into every Poco C51  phone to allow users to erase the Poco C51 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Poco C51 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Poco C51 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

You can request your service provider to unlock your Poco C51  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock
