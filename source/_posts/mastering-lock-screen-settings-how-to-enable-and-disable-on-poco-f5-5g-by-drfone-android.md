- **Step 4:** Once you receive the code, replace your current SIM with one from a different carrier. When prompted, enter the SIM unlock code you received via email.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Poco F5 5G  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.
- **Step 4:** Once the payment is processed, you’ll receive the unlock code via SMS or email. Insert a SIM from a different carrier into your Pixel, then enter the received [<u>unlock code</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) when prompted.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Poco device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

### Important Considerations

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement. The primary advantage of unlocking your SIM is the freedom to use your Poco F5 5G with any carrier’s SIM card, offering greater flexibility and control over your mobile experience. Thus, it is encouraged not to do anything illegal to avoid future complications.
