If the fingerprint sensor fails to recognize your fingerprint, it might be due to inadequate pressure. This could also be due to improper finger placement on the sensor.

Ensure you firmly place your finger on the sensor, covering it entirely. Avoid too much pressure, but make sure the sensor fully contacts your fingerprint.

#### Problem

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Poco C55 device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option. On the following screen, hit the "System update" option to check if any latest update is available. Here, if you see any updates, download and install them promptly.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Poco C55 device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

Use compressed air or a soft brush if there's visible debris or particles around the sensor. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure that might damage the sensor.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands.

Be cautious while cleaning the screen to avoid covering or smudging the area around the fingerprint sensor. Precise cleaning around this area prevents interference with sensor functionality.

Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555171833750.jpg)

- • Click on Personal and tap on Security.
- • Go to Advanced and tap on Trust agents and make sure Smart Lock is turned on.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555174399892.jpg)

- • Under Screen Security tap Smart Lock.
- • Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555175242280.jpg)

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555176091774.jpg)

## Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices

You can decide on a trusted device to be paired with Smart Lock Android.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555177245258.jpg)

For example, you can set up a Smart Lock for Bluetooth in your Android Bluetooth settings. It can also be done for Android NFC unlock devices. Examples include the Bluetooth system in your car, NFC unlocks, android sticker on the car's phone dock, or Bluetooth in your watch.

- • Go to Settings.
- • Tap on Security and then Smart Lock.
- • Existing paired options are listed under Trusted Devices.
- • Initially, trusted devices will show None.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555179612746.jpg)

Tap on Add Trusted Devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555180455802.jpg)

The next screen is the Choose Device Type.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555181196889.jpg)

Since you have already paired Bluetooth, it will ask you to choose the Poco C55 device from the list.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555182031784.jpg)

- • As an example, let's take the case of LG HBS800. It may show Not connected until you add it.
- • It will show up under Trusted devices in the Smart Lock menu.
- • When you turn the added device on, Smart Lock now unlocks the Android mobile.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555183103300.jpg)

Similarly, other Bluetooth and NFC unlock android supported gadgets can be added under the list of Trusted Devices.

## Part 3: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Locations

You can also add locations or addresses to Smart Lock Trusted Locations, and the phone unlocks automatically as soon as you arrive at the desired location. For example, you can set up your home or work address under Trusted Locations.

Check current settings first.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555198742115.jpg)

On a new Android phone, visit Settings>Personal.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555199012102.jpg)

Then Lock Screen and Security.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555199294567.jpg)

Then Secure Lock Settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555200321422.jpg)

Tap Smart Lock.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555200954549.jpg)

Tap on Trusted Places.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555201755742.jpg)

Tap on Add Trusted Places

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555202394199.jpg)

- • Initiate the Google Maps app on the Android phone. Make sure the Internet and GPS are on.
- • Pick a place.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555203265722.jpg)

- • Click on Settings.
- • Click on Edit home or work. You can now add or edit the required addresses.
- • As an example, click on the Enter work address.
- • You now have the option to type in the address or use the address listed on Google Maps as the required work address.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555204276666.jpg)

- • A successful addition is listed and can be edited under the Edit work address.
- • Close the Google Maps app.
- • The work address is automatically propagated and configured with Smart Lock settings.
- • Go back to Settings> Security> Smart Lock> Trusted Places.
- • The work address you added is now listed under Work.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555205535430.jpg)

- • However, it is not yet configured as a Smart Lock option. Tap the location once, and it is enabled.
- • The switch along the address to the right turns blue, indicating it is enabled.
- • The work address is now listed under Trusted places for Work.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555206499484.jpg)

- • The phone is now configured for the work address and will unlock whenever you are at the location.
- • Since it works on Google Maps, the feature works through an Internet connection.

## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Poco C55 device. Once you set up the Poco C55 device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Poco C55 device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Poco C55 device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Poco C55 device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Poco C55 device.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

_How To Improve Facial Recognition In Your Bluetooth and Android NFC Unlock Devices_

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

- • If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- • Tap on Improve face matching.
- • Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
