However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Poco C50  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Poco C50  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

Almost all Android smartphones, including Poco C50 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Poco C50  phone using a third-party tool.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Poco C50 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Poco C50 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Poco C50  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Poco C50 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Poco C50  device.
