## How to Remove Operator Lock on Motorola Edge 2023 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Motorola Edge 2023 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Motorola Edge 2023  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Motorola Edge 2023 :
