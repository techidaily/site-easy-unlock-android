So, to have a complete control over the Poco X6  device, it is important to unlock the bootloader and the process has to be carried out diligently. One of the initial things that needs to be ensured is that the Poco X6  device is fully charged or atleast 80% mark. Make sure you have the fastboot drivers for the Poco X6 device configured on the windows machine and the Android SDK. Here are some of the steps which can be followed to unlock bootloader.

Step 1: It is always very important to keep the phone data backed up and more so when you are planning to unlock the bootloader.

As one of the initial measures, backup the Poco X6 device completely as bootloader unlocking process will wipe all the data off. So, backup all the data like photos, contacts, multimedia files, documents, etc.

Step 2: Go to htcdev.com/bootloader. Ensure that you are registered with HTC and once the sign up is done, log in to HTC dev.

![htc unlock bootloader](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822578154999.jpg)

Now, ensure that HTC Sync Manager is installed on the PC.

Step 3: From the bootloader page, select your device using the drop down option as shown in the picture below.

![htc unlock bootloader](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822578344435.jpg)

After selecting the Poco X6 device, click on “Begin Unlock Bootloader”, and then confirm all the dialogue boxes which come your way on screen.

Step 4: Now, you will be presented with four steps to put the Poco X6 device in bootloader mode. Disconnect the Poco X6  device from the PC and turn the Poco X6 device off completely. Press the volume down button along with the power button to switch the Poco X6 device on in bootloader mode.

Step 5: Use the volume keys of the Poco X6 device to select Fastboot option along with pressing power button to confirm, after the Poco X6 device is in bootloader mode. Now, connect the Poco X6 device to the computer using a USB cable.

![htc unlock bootloader](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822588941681.jpg)

Step 6: Go to Fastboot folder on the PC and holding down the shift key, click on any empty space followed by a click on “Open command window here”.

Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter. Poco X6  will show up in the command prompt.

Note: The drivers have to be installed correctly to see the Poco X6 device in the command prompt. So, if the Poco X6 device does not show up, reinstall HTC Sync Manager and try again after restarting the computer.

Step 8: On HTC Dev’s website third page, click on “proceed to Step 9”. Follow the steps listed and then click on submit. The unlock token code for the Poco X6 device will be mailed by HTC. Download the token and name it “Unlock\_code.bin” and place the token in the fastboot folder.

Step 9: Now, in the command prompt window, type the following:

fastboot flash unlocktoken Unlock\_code.bin

Step 10: On the Poco X6 , one message will appear asking if you want to unlock the Poco X6 device bootloader.

![htc unlock bootloader](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822585759420.jpg)

Use volume keys to select and power button to confirm. Once this is done, the Poco X6  device will restart once and it’s done. The device is now bootloader unlocked.
