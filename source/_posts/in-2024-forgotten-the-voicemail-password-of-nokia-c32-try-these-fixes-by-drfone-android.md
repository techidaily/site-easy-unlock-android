From your mobile device, dial 123 to see the password for your voicemail. To enable (add) or disable (delete) your voicemail password, choose option 4. To enable or disable the screen password, select option 1. If your password has been deactivated, dialing 123 will not ask you to enter one.

You may access your mailbox on another phone if your phone is out of reach or the battery is dead. Make a call to your phone number from a different one.
