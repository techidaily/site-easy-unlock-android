Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.

ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well.

Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.

- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Poco M6 5G device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.
