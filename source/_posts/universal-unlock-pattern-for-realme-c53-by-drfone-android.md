The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Realme C53 device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
