You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Realme device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement.
