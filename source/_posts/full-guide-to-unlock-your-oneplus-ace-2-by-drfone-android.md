There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to.

- You may simply want better access on your device. Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the OnePlus Ace 2 device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.

## Part 3. 6 Private Apps that you should lock on your Android

### 1\. The Messaging App

This is the application that allows you to send and receive messages. You may want to lock this app if you use your device to send messages of a sensitive nature that you would rather keep private. You may also want to lock this app if your device is used by more than one person and you don’t want other users reading your messages.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-08.jpg)

### 2\. Email App

### 3\. Google Play Services

### 4\. Gallery App

The Gallery app displays all the images on your device. The main reason you may want to lock the Gallery app may be because you have sensitive images that are not suitable for all viewers.

### 5\. Music Pla\_x\_yer App
