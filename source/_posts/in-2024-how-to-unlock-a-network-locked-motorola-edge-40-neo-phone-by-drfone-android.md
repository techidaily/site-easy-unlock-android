## How to Unlock a Network Locked Motorola Edge 40 Neo Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Motorola Edge 40 Neo phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Motorola Edge 40 Neo network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Motorola Edge 40 Neo Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Motorola Edge 40 Neo phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Motorola Edge 40 Neo phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
