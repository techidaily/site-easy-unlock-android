## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Nokia 105 Classic 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Nokia 105 Classic device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

Downloading the **RootJunky FRP** bypass tool from unofficial sources can introduce malware risks, so stick to trusted sources like the official website. Additionally, when exploring RootJunky, it is vital to keep the following in mind:

## Method 2: Unlock Your Nokia 105 Classic  Phone Using Wondershare Dr.Fone ( Easy & Fast)

Now, since the previous method of unlocking your Nokia 105 Classic  phone was deprecated after Android 4.4, what about the phones running newer versions? How to unlock a Nokia 105 Classic  phone with a newer Android version? There are still a few methods that are available to you, but the best way to unlock a Nokia 105 Classic  phone is to use this nifty little app called Wondershare Dr.Fone. And you will discover that there is nothing little about this app!

Dr.Fone is a collection of several modules unified in a single interface. Each of these modules is designed meticulously to serve a purpose for your device, such as unlocking your phone, repairing your phone, erasing data from your phone or wiping the phone securely, etc. With this approach, users are never encumbered with options. Instead, they can focus on every task in the simplest, easiest manner without worrying about doing something untoward because they could not understand the software. Dr.Fone is fast, intuitive and easy to use.

**Step 2:** Click Unlock Android Screen.

**Step 3:** Select the first option – 100% Remove Screen Lock as Nokia 105 Classic  devices cannot be unlocked without data loss.

Your Nokia 105 Classic  phone screen is now unlocked. Click the button below to unlock Nokia 105 Classic  phone password without factory reset now!


## Method 3: Factory Reset Nokia 105 Classic  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Nokia 105 Classic  phone to allow users to erase the Nokia 105 Classic device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Nokia 105 Classic  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Google Find My Device is an online service by Google that is used to locate and track your Android devices. It works like how Apple's Find My works for its range of hardware. Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Nokia 105 Classic device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Nokia 105 Classic device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click Find A Lost Device.

**Step 4:** Select the Android device you want to wipe carefully if you have a few:

![erase phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-11.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Nokia 105 Classic  Phone

If your Nokia 105 Classic  phone is tied to a service contract and you want to unlock your device to use it with other service providers, this method is for you. You can request your service provider to unlock your Nokia 105 Classic  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

Sometimes, you may not need to secure your device at all. For example, if you have an old device that you want to use as a media player in your car or to give to children to play games, you may not want to password-protect the Nokia 105 Classic device. This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

### Conclusion

There are a handful of methods you can use to unlock a Nokia 105 Classic  phone in case you forget the password or PIN or pattern. Especially for the old pattern-based screen locks, it is easy to unlock the phone if you know the answers to the security questions in your Google account. However, to unlock Nokia 105 Classic  phone screen without password on newer Android versions, you need technical knowledge, or you can use third-party software such as Wondershare Dr.Fone. Using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock, you can unlock your phone quickly with no technical mumbo jumbo to confuse you. All you will get is a software that guides you every step of the way so you can unlock Nokia 105 Classic  phone easily.
