## Part 1: Lock System About OnePlus Open  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **OnePlus Open  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. OnePlus Open  is one of the older versions of OnePlus  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. OnePlus Open  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on OnePlus Open  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your OnePlus Open  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock OnePlus Open  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **OnePlus Open  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock OnePlus Open  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

### 2: Google Account

Here is how you can do an **OnePlus Open  pattern unlock without PC**. You don't need any third-party software or device for this method. Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your OnePlus  device using your Google Account.

![OnePlus Open  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

### 3: Answer Security Questions

If you want to unlock your OnePlus  phone, you can also answer some security questions and reset the password. This method does not work on all OnePlus  devices, but you can use it for **OnePlus Open  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the OnePlus Open device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock OnePlus Open  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **OnePlus Open  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your OnePlus Open  with the power button.

## How to Unlock a Network Locked OnePlus Open Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of OnePlus Open phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the OnePlus Open device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **OnePlus Open network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your OnePlus Open Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked OnePlus Open phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
