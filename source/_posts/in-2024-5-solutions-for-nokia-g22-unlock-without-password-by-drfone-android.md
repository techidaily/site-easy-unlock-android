Before we move towards the **Nokia G22  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Nokia G22  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Nokia G22  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Nokia G22  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nokia G22  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Nokia G22  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Nokia G22  with the power button.

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
