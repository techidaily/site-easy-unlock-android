## Part 1: Lock System About Nokia C32  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Nokia C32  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Nokia C32  is one of the older versions of Nokia  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Nokia C32  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Nokia C32  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Nokia C32  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Nokia C32  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nokia C32  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Nokia  device using your Google Account.

![Nokia C32  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

### 3: Answer Security Questions

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Nokia C32  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Nokia C32  with the power button.
