## Part 1: Lock System About Poco X6 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Poco X6 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Poco X6 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Poco X6 Pro  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Poco X6 Pro  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Poco X6 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Poco X6 Pro  with the power button.
