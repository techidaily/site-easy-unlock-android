Google Assistant is a virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) developed by tech giant Google. This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.

## Part 2. How To Use Google Assistant on Lock Screen

After you've successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.

Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.

## Part 5: Unlock locked Poco M6 Pro 5G  phone with Gmail ID and password

It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Poco M6 Pro 5G  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android. Among all the tricks of how to reset a Poco M6 Pro 5G  phone that is locked, it only works if you are running around version 4.4 KitKat or older than that. Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Poco M6 Pro 5G device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**

At first, you need to make five attempts to unlock your device. Whether you have used a PIN or Pattern lock, Android will always give you five attempts to get the password right. Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password/Pattern” option on Your Poco M6 Pro 5G. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.
