## Part 1: Lock System About Nokia C12  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Nokia C12  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Nokia C12  is one of the older versions of Nokia  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Nokia C12  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Nokia C12  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Nokia C12  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Nokia C12  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Nokia C12  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Nokia C12  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Nokia C12  with the power button.
