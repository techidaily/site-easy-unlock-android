## How to Unlock a Network Locked Nokia 105 Classic Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Nokia 105 Classic phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Nokia 105 Classic device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Nokia 105 Classic network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Nokia 105 Classic Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Nokia 105 Classic phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.

Use the [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) if you don't want to lose your data. Dr.Fone allows you to unlock your Nokia 105 Classic  within minutes with easy-to-follow steps. It works for all old and new Nokia  models, and the procedure is the same for every device. You can also use Dr.Fone to recover data, repair android software problems, and fix other issues.
