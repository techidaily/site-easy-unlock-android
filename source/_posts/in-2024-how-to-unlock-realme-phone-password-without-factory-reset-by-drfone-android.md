## How to Unlock a Network Locked Realme 12 5G Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Realme 12 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Realme 12 5G device is purchased.
