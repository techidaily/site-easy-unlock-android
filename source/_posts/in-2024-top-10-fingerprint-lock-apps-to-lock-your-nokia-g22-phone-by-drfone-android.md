Now, the question is, is it possible **to track an IMEI number through Google Earth**? This question has sparked much debate on the internet, so this article aims to find it out. Keep reading and learn the secrets of **Google Earth IMEI trackers**.

![google earth imei tracker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Track Your Nokia G22 on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.
- **Step 4:** Launch Google Earth on your computer or mobile device, then select **Your timeline** from the Google Maps menu. The operation will take you to the Google Maps Timeline page.

![your timeline on google maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-04.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Select the day you wish to see the phone's location history. Choose the Nokia G22 device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

![google maps location history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-05.jpg)

![knox manage admin portal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-knox-enrollment-service-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is the Knox Enrollment Service?

**Knox Enrollment Service** is an integral part of Samsung’s Knox, a toolbox of security features for enterprise-level management of mobile devices. This service is pivotal in how companies manage and secure their mobile devices, especially in a corporate environment.

### What It Is

**Knox Enrollment Service by Samsung** is a tool businesses use to automatically enroll Samsung devices into their management systems when the Nokia G22 device is connected to the internet. It’s designed for IT administrators to easily deploy, manage, and enforce policies across devices in their network, ensuring consistency and security.

### What It Does

The service allows IT administrators to pre-configure settings and apps and manage other aspects of the Nokia G22 device’s functionality. When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored. The administrators can push updates, track device locations, remotely wipe data for security, and enforce specific compliance policies. This automation of device enrollment simplifies the setup process for both the IT department and the end-user.

![knox mobile enrolment page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-knox-enrollment-service-02.jpg)

### Advantages

Of course, Samsung Knox would not be popular without any advantages. Here are some of them:

- **Enhanced security.** Knox Enrollment Service ensures corporate devices have robust security features. This helps in safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access.
- **Streamlined management.**It simplifies the Nokia G22 device management, allowing administrators to configure devices without physical access.
- The service enables the customization of devices to fit specific business needs, including installing necessary applications and restrictions on unauthorized apps.
- **Compliance Assurance.** With the ability to have policies remotely, companies can ensure that all devices comply with corporate standards and regulations.

### Disadvantages

However, it also has some disadvantages:

- **Restrictive for users.**For employees, this can mean reduced control over their devices. After all, certain functionalities might be restricted by the employer.
- **Potential privacy concerns.** The ability of IT administrators to monitor and control devices may raise privacy concerns among employees.
- **Complexity in management.** While it simplifies many aspects, managing many devices through Knox can become complex. This is particular in diverse environments with different user needs.

**Knox Enrollment Service** is a powerful tool for enterprise mobile management, offering enhanced security and simplified device management. However, it also introduces challenges, particularly regarding user autonomy and privacy. Understanding these advantages and disadvantages is crucial before removing or bypassing this service.

## Part 2: How To Remove Knox Enrollment Service on Your Nokia G22

In most cases, an administrator can only effectively **remove the Knox Enrollment Service** through the Samsung Knox Portal. This typically requires cooperation from your employer.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to removing itfrom the Admin’s Portal:

- **Step 1:** Sign in to the Samsung Knox Portal using administrative credentials.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment**, then click **Devices.**
- **Step 3:** Select the Nokia G22 device in question and click **Actions.**
- **Step 4:** Choose the **Clear Profile** option to remove all profiles from the Nokia G22 device. This action will disassociate the Nokia G22 device from any existing Knox configurations.

![knox unenroll confirmation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-knox-enrollment-service-03.jpg)

After removing the Nokia G22 device from Knox Enrollment via the admin account, you may still need to uninstall the Knox app from the Android device. This can usually be done through the Nokia G22 device’s settings. Navigate to ‘Apps’ in the settings menu, locate the Knox app, and select ‘Uninstall’ or ‘Disable’. Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Nokia G22 device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Nokia G22 device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesn’t include the Knox software.

However, this method is risky and not recommended for the average user. It will void your warranty and potentially ‘brick’ your device, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.

**Removing Knox Enrollment Service** from your phone is feasible but requires careful consideration, especially in a corporate context. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the risks of modifying your device’s software.
