## Method 1: Unlock Honor Magic 6 Pro  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Honor Magic 6 Pro  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Honor Magic 6 Pro  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Honor Magic 6 Pro  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Honor Magic 6 Pro  phone.

### Side Tip

It makes sense given that our phones hold a substantially large part of our personal and professional lives these days.

You can request your service provider to unlock your Honor Magic 6 Pro  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock
