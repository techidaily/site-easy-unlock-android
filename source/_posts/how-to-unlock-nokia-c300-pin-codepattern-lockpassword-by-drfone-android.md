## How to Unlock Nokia C300  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Nokia C300 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Nokia C300  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Nokia C300  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Nokia C300 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone.

- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Nokia C300  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Nokia C300  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Nokia C300  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Nokia C300  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Nokia C300 ?

If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Nokia C300  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Nokia C300 :

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device.
