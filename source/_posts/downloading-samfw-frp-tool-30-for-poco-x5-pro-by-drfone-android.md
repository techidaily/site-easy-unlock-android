### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Poco X5 Pro device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Poco X5 Pro device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:
