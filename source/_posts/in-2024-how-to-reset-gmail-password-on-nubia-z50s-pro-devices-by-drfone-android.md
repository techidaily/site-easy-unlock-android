- **Step 6:** Enter your new password twice, then tap OK.
- **Step 7:** Your new password will now be in effect.

### 3\. Don’t you have face or fingerprint unlock? Let’s set them up.  

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings app on your Samsung phone.
- **Step 2:** Tap on the "Lock Screen" option.
- **Step 3:** Select "Screen Lock Type."
- **Step 4:** Choose the "Fingerprints" or "Face unlock" option.
