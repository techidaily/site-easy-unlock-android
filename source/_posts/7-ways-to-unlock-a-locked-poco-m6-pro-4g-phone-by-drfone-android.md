**Step 4.** To reset the **lock screen pattern**, you must give the correct details of the Google ID previously logged into the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.

**Step 5.** After giving the correct details, you can provide another pattern lock to the phone.

**Step 6.** Affirm your decision and set another **pattern lock** on your phone.

### 3\. Emergency Call Trick (For Android 5 or 5.1.1)

**Step 1:** Tap the Emergency Call button and enter ten asterisks (\*).

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the asterisks on the dialer until you no longer see the paste choice.

**Step 3:** Return to the lock screen and tap on the camera symbol.

**Step 4:** Press the settings choice on your Android gadget after pulling down the notification tray. Now you will have the chance to enter the PIN/password, and you ought to continue unlocking your Android phone. Continue to paste until the lock screen UI crashes.

### 4\. Safe Mode Boot (For Android 4.1 or later)

**Step 1:** You can bring up the power menu and hold the "Power Off" button for most phones, especially Android phones. A warning will spring up, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Here, it would help if you had to press Ok.

**Step 2:** Clear your lock screen application's data.

Clean data off your lock screen app, uninstall it, and then reboot your device to escape safe mode. When you do so, your phone or Android device will unlock.

### 5\. Use ADB (USB required for Android 10 and lower)

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases

sqlite3 settings.db

update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';

update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';

.quit

exit

adb reboot

- After your gadget has rebooted, enter the command below:

adb shell

rm/data/framework/gesture.key

exit

adb reboot

- Your phone will reboot. After it reboots and requests a security pattern, you can utilize any pattern, and it will unlock.

### Conclusion

However, we suggest you go for a professional tool while carrying this out. Therefore, you should choose an expert tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock to open the **lock screen pattern**.
