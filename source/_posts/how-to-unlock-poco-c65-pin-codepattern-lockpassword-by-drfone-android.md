## How to Unlock Poco C65  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Poco C65 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Poco C65  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Poco C65  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Poco C65 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Poco C65  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Poco C65  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

So, if you still want to unlock Poco C65  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Poco C65 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Poco C65 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Poco C65  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Poco C65 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)
