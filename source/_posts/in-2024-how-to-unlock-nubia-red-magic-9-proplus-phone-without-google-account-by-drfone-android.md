Forgetting your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common. For such instances, there are several methods that you can use to unlock your screen, 5 of which we have discussed in this article.

If you’re looking for ways that are time-effective and reliable, you can use your Google account or other ways to unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  and set a new screen lock. However, with these methods, you can lose your data, so we only recommend using them if your device is backed up.
