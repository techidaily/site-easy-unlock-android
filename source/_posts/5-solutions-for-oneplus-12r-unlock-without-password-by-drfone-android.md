## Part 1: Lock System About OnePlus 12R  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **OnePlus 12R  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. OnePlus 12R  is one of the older versions of OnePlus  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. OnePlus 12R  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on OnePlus 12R  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your OnePlus 12R  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **OnePlus 12R  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock OnePlus 12R  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device.

Here are the steps to unlock OnePlus 12R  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **OnePlus 12R  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your OnePlus 12R  with the power button.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on OnePlus 12R ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the OnePlus 12R device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your OnePlus 12R  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a OnePlus 12R :

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device.
