You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.
