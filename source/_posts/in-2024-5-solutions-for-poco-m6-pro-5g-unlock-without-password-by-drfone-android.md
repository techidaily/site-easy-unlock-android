## Part 1: Lock System About Poco M6 Pro 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Poco M6 Pro 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Poco M6 Pro 5G  is one of the older versions of Poco  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Poco M6 Pro 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Poco M6 Pro 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Poco M6 Pro 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Poco M6 Pro 5G  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Poco M6 Pro 5G  with Find My Device.

Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Poco  device using your Google Account.

![Poco M6 Pro 5G  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

This method does not work on all Poco  devices, but you can use it for **Poco M6 Pro 5G  screen unlock without PC**.

You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Poco M6 Pro 5G  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Poco M6 Pro 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Poco M6 Pro 5G  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)

## Method 3: Factory Reset Poco M6 Pro 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.

That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.

![android emergency call screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg)

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

![android emergency screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.
