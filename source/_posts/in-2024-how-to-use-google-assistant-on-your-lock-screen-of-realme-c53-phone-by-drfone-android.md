Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes.

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.
