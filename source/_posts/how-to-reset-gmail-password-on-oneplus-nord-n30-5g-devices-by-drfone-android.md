If your phone has a removable SD card, you can also try this technique to disable the pattern/password on your device. Though, you need to have some custom recovery installed on your device for this method. You can always go for TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) and flash it on your device.

TWRP: <https://twrp.me/>

Also, since you can't move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card. After ensuring that you have met all the basic prerequisites, follow these steps and learn how to unlock the OnePlus phone's forgotten password using a custom recovery.

- **Step 1.** Download a [Pattern Password Disable](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) application and save its ZIP file on your computer. Now, insert your SD card into your system and move the recently downloaded file to it.

- **Step 2.** Reboot your phone into recovery mode. For instance, the TWRP recovery mode can be turned on by simultaneously pressing the Power, Home, and Volume Up button. You would get different options on your screen after entering the custom recovery mode. Tap on “Install” and browse the Pattern Password Disable application file.

- **Step 3.** Install the above-mentioned application and wait for a few minutes. Afterward, restart your OnePlus phone. Ideally, your phone will be restarted without any lock screen. If you get a lock screen, you can bypass it by entering any random digits.

## Solution 5: Factory Reset OnePlus Phone in Recovery Mode (erases all phone data)

If none of the above-mentioned alternatives work, then you can also try to factory reset your device. This will erase every kind of data from your device and make it look brand new by resetting it. Though, you can easily resolve the forgot password on the OnePlus phone with it. Therefore, before proceeding, you need to be familiar with all the repercussions of performing a factory reset. All you got to do is follow these steps.

- **Step 1.** Put your OnePlus phone on its recovery mode with correct key combinations. To do this, firstly, turn your device off and let it rest for a few seconds. Now, press the Power and Volume Down key at the same time. Keep pressing them until you see LG's logo on the screen. Release the buttons for a few seconds and press them again at the same time. Again, keep pressing the buttons until you see the recovery mode menu. This technique works with most OnePlus devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.

- **Step 2.** Choose “Wipe Data/Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power/home key to select anything. Use these keys and select the “Wipe Data/Factory Reset” option. You might get another pop-up asking to delete all user data. Just agree it reset your device. Sit back and relax as your device will perform a hard reset.

After following these steps, you can easily overcome how to unlock the OnePlus phone forgot password issue.

## Solution 6: Unlock OnePlus Phone Using ADB Command (need USB debugging enabled)

This might be a little complicated initially, but if you don't want to follow either of the above-mentioned techniques to unlock your device, you can go with this alternative. Before proceeding, make sure that you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, then you can download Android SDK right [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

Additionally, it would help if you turned on the USB Debugging feature on your phone before you forgot the password. If USB debugging is not turned on before, then this method will not work for you.

After making your device ready and downloading all the essential software on your computer, follow these steps to learn how to unlock your OnePlus phone if you forgot the password.

- **Step 1.** Connect your device to the computer with a USB cable and open the command prompt when it is successfully connected. If you get a pop-up message regarding USB Debugging permission on your device, simply agree to it and continue.

- **Step 2.** Now, please provide the following code on the command prompt and reboot your device when it is processed. If you want, you can also tweak the code a little and provide a new lock pin.

- _ADB_ _shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.__db_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen__.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![unlock lg forgot password - command code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892205231542.jpg)

- **Step 3.** If the above code doesn't work, try providing the code “ADB _shell rm /data/system/gesture. the key_” to it and follow the same drill.
