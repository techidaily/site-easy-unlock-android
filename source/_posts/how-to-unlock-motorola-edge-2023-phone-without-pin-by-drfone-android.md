Google Assistant is a versatile virtual assistant that is designed to help you with a wide range of tasks and make your daily life more convenient. Accessible on most modern Android devices, it enables users to perform several tasks through voice commands.

However, if you are looking for ways to **unlock phone with Google Assistant**, this function is no longer available. **Google Assistant unlock** feature has been discontinued since 2021. But in case you've forgotten the screen lock passcode, you can use Wondershare Dr.Fone Screen Unlock tool to regain access to your Android phone. This tool facilitates the unlocking process without data loss, featuring a user-friendly learning curve.
